DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ENDOGENEITY AND SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS, THE AUTHORS DRAW FROM THE THEORY OF IMPACT EVALUATION IN NONRANDOM EXPERIMENT, EMPLOYING THE ENDOGENOUS SWITCHING REGRESSION (ESR) WHILE USING THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM) TO CHECK FOR ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT MEAN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT AND THOSE THAT DID NOT HAVE ACCESS. FURTHER, THE RESULTS REVEALED FARM SIZE, LABOR; GENDER, AGE, LITERACY, WEALTH AND GROUP MEMBERSHIP AS THE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF BOTH CREDIT ACCESS AND INCOME IN THE TWO ZONES. WITH THE ESR, CREDIT ACCESS INCREASES HOUSEHOLDS FARM INCOME BY GH & 206.56/HA AND GH & 39.74/HA IN THE TRANSITIONAL AND SAVANNA ZONES, RESPECTIVELY, BUT WITH THE PSM, CREDIT INCREASES FARM INCOME BY GH & 201.50 AND GH & 45.69 AND IN THE TRANSITIONAL AND SAVANNA, RESPECTIVELY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE MEAN DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOUSEHOLDS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLD'S COVARIATES IN THE TWO ZONES. THE RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES, INFORMATION AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS IN IMPROVED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND FARM INCOME. ALSO, THE RESULTS FROM BOTH METHODS INDICATE THAT CREDIT ACCESS LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN FARM INCOME FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH ZONES. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES EXIST IN THE RESULTS OF PSM AND THAT OF THE ESR RESULTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS IN THE SAMPLES SUGGESTS THAT THE USE OF ESR AND PSM TECHNIQUES IS APPROPRIATE. FURTHER, THE RESULTS SUGGESTING THAT ENHANCED CREDIT ACCESS AND FARM INCOME COULD BE ATTAINED THROUGH IMPROVED ACCESS TO HOUSEHOLD RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THE NEED FOR ESTABLISHING AND EXPANDING CREDIT PROGRAMS TO COVER MORE HOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH ZONES. THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF CREDIT BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS EMPLOYED IN EACH ZONE REVEALED THE WEAKNESS OF EACH MODEL. THE LOW VALUES FROM PSM COULD INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS RESULTING FROM UNOBSERVABLE FACTORS WHILES THE HIGH VALUES FROM THE ESR COULD STEM FROM THE RESTRICTIVE ASSUMPTION OF THE MODEL. THIS REINFORCES THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBINING MIXED METHODS TO CHECK ROBUSTNESS OF RESULTS AND TO EXPLORE THE WEAKNESS OF EACH METHOD EMPLOYED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY LIES IN THE USE OF A VERY EXTENSIVE AND UNIQUE DATA SET TO DECOMPOSE THE DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT ACCESS AND FARM INCOME AND AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS OF CREDIT INTO ZONES.","[ABDALLAH, ABDUL-HANAN] UNIV DEV STUDIES, DEPT AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT & FINANCE, TAMALE, GHANA.; [AYAMGA, MICHEAL; AWUNI, JOSEPH A.] UNIV DEV STUDIES, DEPT AGR & RESOURCE ECON, TAMALE, GHANA.","ABDALLAH, AH (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV DEV STUDIES, DEPT AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT & FINANCE, TAMALE, GHANA.","ABDALLAHABDULHANAN@GMAIL.COM; MAYAMGA@UDS.EDU.GH; JOSEPHAWUNIGH@YAHOO.CO.UK",NA,NA,"ABDALLAH AH, 2016, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V76, P494, DOI 10.1108/AFR-05-2016-0052; ABDALLAH AH, 2016, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V76, P309, DOI 10.1108/AFR-01-2016-0002; ABDULAI A, 2006, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V11, P201, DOI 10.1017/S1355770X05002779; ABDULAI A., 2008, PROPERTY RIGHTS INVE; ABEBAW D, 2013, FOOD POLICY, V38, P82, DOI 10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2012.10.003; ABU BM, 2017, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V77, P524, DOI [10.1108/AFR-02-2017-0007, 10.1108/AFR-02-2017-0007]; ADAM I., 2015, THESIS; AFARI E, 2001, THESIS; AKRAM W., 2008, EUROPEAN J SCI RES, V23, P294; AKUDUGU M.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - DUE TO THEIR HIGH-GROWTH POTENTIAL, WOMEN-OWNED SMES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST. THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND MCKINSEY BUILT A DETAILED DATABASE FOR MICRO-, SMALL-, AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES. THE DATA DERIVED FROM THE READILY AVAILABLE GLOBAL DATA SETS PROVIDE COVERAGE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND NATIONAL STATISTICS.

THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EXAMINE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SELF-EMPLOYED IMMIGRANTS IN THE CREDIT MARKET OF A DEVELOPED ECONOMY OUTSIDE THE US. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS CONSIDER ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL A MORE SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO THEIR SELF-EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES THAN DO NATIVE SWEDES AND EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS. SELF-EMPLOYED NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS REPORT MORE DISCRIMINATION BY BANKS, SUPPLIERS, AND CUSTOMERS THAN DO NATIVES AND IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IMMIGRANT-OWNED FIRMS APPLY FOR BANK LOANS TO A LARGER EXTENT THAN DO FIRMS OWNED BY NATIVES. NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NATIVES TO HAVE A LOAN DENIED, AND THEY ARE ALSO CHARGED HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THEIR BANK LOANS THAN NATIVES. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT ROBUSTNESS CHECKS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION IN THE MARKET FOR BANK LOANS IS PUT FORWARD AS AN EXPLANATION FOR THESE RESULTS. LIMITED OR LACK OF ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO SELF-EMPLOYMENT AMONG CERTAIN IMMIGRANT GROUPS. THIS OBSTACLE MAY BE ONE EXPLANATION FOR THE HIGH EXIT RATES FROM SELF-EMPLOYMENT AMONG IMMIGRANTS, A FINDING THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES INCLUDING SWEDEN.","[ALDEN, LINA; HAMMARSTEDT, MATS] LINNAEUS UNIV, CTR LABOUR MARKET & DISCRIMINAT STUDIES, SE-35195 VAXJO, SWEDEN.","ALDEN, L; HAMMARSTEDT, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), LINNAEUS UNIV, CTR LABOUR MARKET & DISCRIMINAT STUDIES, SE-35195 VAXJO, SWEDEN.","LINA.ALDEN@LNU.SE; MATS.HAMMARSTEDT@LNU.SE","JAN WALLANDER AND TOM HEDELIUS FOUNDATION","ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR LINA ALDEN, CENTRE FOR LABOUR MARKET AND DISCRIMINATION STUDIES, LINNAEUS UNIVERSITY, SE-351 95 VAXJO, SWEDEN, LINA.ALDEN@LNU.SE.

FIRST, URBAN MBES ARE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED GEOGRAPHICALLY IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES, RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING FINANCING REFLECT FIRM LOCATION, MINORITY OWNERSHIP, OR BOTH. SECOND, APPLICABLE STUDIES REST ON WEAK THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS. THE AUTHORS' FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BANKS ENGAGE IN DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES LIMITING CREDIT AVAILABILITY TO MBES. CONTROLLING FOR RISK FACTORS, HOWEVER, FIRM LOCATION IN A MINORITY OR INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS NO APPARENT IMPACT ON LOAN AVAILABILITY OR SIZE. OWNER RACE/ETHNICITY, IN CONTRAST, IS IMPORTANT.

THE PAPER USED SPSS (STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENTIST) AND APPLIED MEDGRAPH PROGRAM (EXCEL VERSION 13), SOBEL TEST, AND KENNY & BARON GUIDELINE TO TEST FOR THE MEDIATING ROLE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM A TOTAL SAMPLE OF 400 POOR HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN RURAL UGANDA WHO WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THIS STUDY. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT SOCIAL NETWORKS PARTIALLY MEDIATE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. BESIDES, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACTS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. THIS IMPLIES THAT SOME EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION GO THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS TO CAUSE AN IMPACT ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. THEREFORE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS BANKS AND MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD DEVELOP FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT PROMOTE SOCIAL NETWORKING AMONG POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA.

IN GERMANY, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THIS ISSUE IS SCARCE BECAUSE OF MISSING DATA. THIS PAPER AIMS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER REVIEWS PREVIOUS STUDIES AND USES DATA FROM A SURVEY OF ETHNIC AND NATIVE ENTREPRENEURS IN GERMANY THAT INCLUDE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT START-UP FINANCING. THE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED FOR DIFFERENCES IN FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS USING UNIVARIATE ANALYSES AND APPLY MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODELS TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS IN START-UP FINANCING. FINDINGS - THE DATA PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT ENTREPRENEURS WITH AN IMMIGRATION BACKGROUND (""ETHNIC ENTREPRENEURS""), DEFINED AS GERMAN RESIDENTS WHO HOLD FOREIGN CITIZENSHIP OR WHO WERE BORN OUTSIDE GERMANY, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE DENIED CREDIT OR TO BE AWARDED SMALLER LOANS THAN REQUESTED THAN ARE NATIVE ENTREPRENEURS. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THIS EFFECT MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN RISK FACTORS AND FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, RATHER THAN ETHNICITY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE DATASET CONSISTS OF 234 OBSERVATIONS. THE RESULTS REFER TO THE SAMPLE AND MIGHT NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ETHNIC MINORITY START-UPS IN GENERAL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - APART FROM THE RISK FACTORS OBSERVED IN THE STUDY, COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS AND LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE SOURCES OF EXTERNAL FINANCING MAY BE RELEVANT. BETTER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ETHNIC MINORITY BUSINESSES MAY HELP TO REDUCE THE FINANCING GAP VIS-A-VIS NATIVE ENTREPRENEURS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS IS THE FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF ETHNIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN GERMANY USING UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO OBSERVATIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ETHNIC MINORITIES AND HAS NOT TESTED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO CREDIT.","[BRUDER, JANA; NEUBERGER, DORIS; RATHKE-DOPPNER, SOLVIG] UNIV ROSTOCK, ROSTOCK, GERMANY.","NEUBERGER, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ROSTOCK, ROSTOCK, GERMANY.","DORIS.NEUBERGER@UNI-ROSTOCK.DE",NA,NA,"ANDERLONI L, 2007, NEW FRONTIERS BANKIN, P5; BALLARD J., 2016, WORKING PAPER, DOI 10.24926/8668.0901; BARRETT G., 2002, INT J ENTREPRENEURIA, V8, P11, DOI DOI 10.1108/13552550210423697; BATES T, 1991, Q REV ECON BUS, V31, P64; BAYCAN-LEVENT T., 2007, 112007 VU U; BECKER G., 1957, EC DISCRIMINATION; BESANKO D, 1987, INT ECON REV, V28, P671, DOI 10.2307/2526573; BESTER H, 1985, AM ECON REV, V75, P850; BESTER H, 1987, EUR ECON REV, V31, P887, DOI 10.1016/0014-2921(87)90005-5; BESTER H, 1994, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V26, P72, DOI 10.2307/2078035; BLANCHFLOWER DG, 2003, REV ECON STAT, V85, P930, DOI 10.1162/003465303772815835; BOOT AWA, 2000, J FINANC INTERMED, V9, P7, DOI 10.1006/JFIN.2000.0282; BOSTIC R.

THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE EITHER THE RESULT OF SUPPLY-SIDE DISCRIMINATION, OR DIFFERENCES IN PROFITABILITY BETWEEN FEMALE- AND MALE-OWNED FIRMS. THIS PAPER AIMS AT ANALYSING WHETHER THESE DIFFERENCES ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE CASE OF ITALIAN FIRMS BY MEANS OF A LARGE DATASET ON LINES OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THREE ITALIAN BANKS OVER THE PERIOD 2005-2008. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS SHOW THAT FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AND YOUNGER THAN MALE-OWNED ONES, AND HAVE-ON AVERAGE-A LARGER, BUT SHORTER, NUMBER OF LENDING RELATIONSHIPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MEAN SIZE OF LOANS REQUESTED BY FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS IS SMALLER, AND MORE FREQUENTLY ASSISTED WITH COLLATERAL, PERSONAL GUARANTEES, OR BOTH. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR LOAN, FIRM AND BANK CHARACTERISTICS, ESTIMATES SHOW THAT GENDER DOES NOT AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBTAINING A BANK LOAN. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS, GUARANTEES ARE LESS POWERFUL INSTRUMENTS IN GAINING ACCESS TO CREDIT AND THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING TO PLEDGE COLLATERAL IS HIGHER THAN FOR MALE-OWNED FIRMS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT ACCESS ARE THE RESULT OF DISCRIMINATION AND STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE- AND FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS. POLICIES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS OF FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS TO BANK LOANS SHOULD FAVOR AN INCREASE IN FIRM SIZE THAT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF MORE SOPHISTICATED BUSINESS LEGAL STRUCTURES.","[CALCAGNINI, GIORGIO; GIOMBINI, GERMANA; LENTI, ELISA] UNIV URBINO, DEPT ECON SOC POLIT, VIA SAFFI 42, I-61029 URBINO, PU, ITALY.; [CALCAGNINI, GIORGIO; GIOMBINI, GERMANA] MO FI R, ANCONA, ITALY.","GIOMBINI, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV URBINO, DEPT ECON SOC POLIT, VIA SAFFI 42, I-61029 URBINO, PU, ITALY.","GIORGIO.CALCAGNINI@UNIURB.IT; GERMANA.GIOMBINI@UNIURB.IT",NA,NA,"AI CR, 2003, ECON LETT, V80, P123, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00032-6; ALESINA AF, 2013, J EUR ECON ASSOC, V11, P45, DOI 10.1111/J.1542-4774.2012.01100.X; ASIEDU E, 2012, AM ECON REV, V102, P532, DOI 10.1257/AER.102.3.532; ATERIDO R, 2011, 5571 WORLD BANK; BANK OF ITALY, 2010, STAT B; BECKER G., 1971, EC DISCRIMINATION; BELLUCCI A, 2010, J BANK FINANC, V34, P2968, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2010.07.008; BERGER AN, 1995, J BUS, V68, P351, DOI 10.1086/296668; BERGER AN, 1990, J MONETARY ECON, V25, P21, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(90)90042-3; BERGER AN, 1998, J BANK FINANC, V22, P613, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7; BONTE W, 2013, SMALL BUS ECON, V41, P961, DOI 10.1007/S11187-012-9459-3; BOOT AWA, 1994, INT ECON REV, V35, P899, DOI 10.2307/2527003; BOOT AWA, 1991, ECON J, V101, P458, DOI 10.2307/2233552; CALCAGNINI G, 2008, VINCOLI FINANZIARI C, P45; CALCAGNINI G, 2014, APPL FINANCIAL EC, V6, P397, DOI DOI 10.1080/09603107.2014.881967; CARTER S., 2006, WOMENS BUSINESS OWNE; CESARONI F, 2010, EC PICCOLA IMPRESA, P131; CESARONI F, 2013, QUESTIONI EC E FINAN, P177; COIN D, 2011, ARE WOMEN ENTREPRENE; COLE RA, 2011, 383 FRB, DOI [10.2139/SSRN.1799649, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.1799649]; COLEMAN S, 2009, SMALL BUS ECON, V33, P397, DOI 10.1007/S11187-009-9205-7; FAIRLIE RW, 2009, SMALL BUS ECON, V33, P375, DOI 10.1007/S11187-009-9207-5; FAY M, 1993, J BUS VENTURING, V8, P363, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(93)90005-P; GREENE W.

WE FIND THAT THE SOCIAL-BANKING POLICY HAS PLAYED CRUCIAL ROLE TO FOSTER FINANCIAL INCLUSION ACROSS STATES IN INDIA DURING 1977-1990.

WE ALSO FIND THAT MORE COMPETITIVE BANKS FAVOR FIRM GROWTH ONLY AT HIGH LEVELS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION, WHILE BANK CONCENTRATION IS PARTICULARLY FAVORABLE TO FOREIGN AND STATE-OWNED FIRMS AND INCREASES FIRM GROWTH AT LOW LEVELS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION.

THE IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ALONG WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY ARE DISCUSSED ACCORDINGLY.","[CHEN, DONGYU; LAI, FUJUN] SOOCHOW UNIV, SOOCHOW THINK TANK, RES CTR SMARTER SUPPLY CHAIN, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [CHEN, DONGYU; LAI, FUJUN] SOOCHOW UNIV, DONGWU BUSINESS SCH, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [LI, XIAOLIN] TOWSON UNIV, COLL BUSINESS & ECON, TOWSON, MD USA.; [LAI, FUJUN] UNIV SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI, COLL BUSINESS, LONG BEACH, MS 39560 USA.","LAI, FJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), SOOCHOW UNIV, SOOCHOW THINK TANK, RES CTR SMARTER SUPPLY CHAIN, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; LAI, FJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), SOOCHOW UNIV, DONGWU BUSINESS SCH, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; LAI, FJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI, COLL BUSINESS, LONG BEACH, MS 39560 USA.","CHENDONGYU0125@GMAIL.COM; XLI@TOWSON.EDU; FUJUN.LAI@USM.EDU","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71302008, 71471125]","THIS STUDY IS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (PROJECT NO. 71302008 AND 71471125).","AGIER I, 2013, SMALL BUS ECON, V41, P263, DOI 10.1007/S11187-012-9429-9; AGIER I, 2013, WORLD DEV, V42, P165, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2012.06.016; ALESINA AF, 2013, J EUR ECON ASSOC, V11, P45, DOI 10.1111/J.1542-4774.2012.01100.X; ARROW KJ, 1973, DISCRIMINATION LABOR; BARASINSKA N., 2009, NY TIMES, P1; BARASINSKA N., 2010, AAAI SPRING S INT IN; BARBER BM, 2001, Q J ECON, V116, P261, DOI 10.1162/003355301556400; BAYDAS MM, 1994, WORLD DEV, V22, P1073, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(94)90149-X; BECK T, 2013, REV FINANC, V17, P1279, DOI 10.1093/ROF/RFS028; BECKER GS, 2010, EC DISCRIMINATION; BELLUCCI A, 2010, J BANK FINANC, V34, P2968, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2010.07.008; BERKOVICH E, 2011, ANN FINANC, V7, P389, DOI 10.1007/S10436-011-0178-6; BLANCHFLOWER DG, 2003, REV ECON STAT, V85, P930, DOI 10.1162/003465303772815835; BLAU FD, 2000, J ECON PERSPECT, V14, P75, DOI 10.1257/JEP.14.4.75; BRANA S, 2013, SMALL BUS ECON, V40, P87, DOI 10.1007/S11187-011-9346-3; BROWNE LE, 1995, NEW ENGL ECON REV, P53; BUVINIC M, 1990, WORLD DEV, V18, P695, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(90)90018-S; CARTER S, 2007, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V31, P427, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6520.2007.00181.X; CAVALLUZZO K, 2005, J BUS, V78, P2153, DOI 10.1086/497045; CHAIKEN S, 1980, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V39, P752, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.752; CHEN HB, 2011, 2011 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY (ICMET 2011), P1; COLLIER B, 2010, 2010 ACM CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK, P197; COTTER DA, 2001, SOC FORCES, V80, P655, DOI 10.1353/SOF.2001.0091; D'ESPALLIER B, 2011, WORLD DEV, V39, P758, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2010.10.008; DAVIS JM, 2013, INFORM MANAGE-AMSTER, V50, P125, DOI 10.1016/J.IM.2012.09.004; DE MEL S, 2009, AM ECON J-APPL ECON, V1, P1, DOI 10.1257/APP.1.3.1; DOLEAC JL, 2013, ECON J, V123, PF469, DOI 10.1111/ECOJ.12082; DUARTE J, 2012, REV FINANC STUD, V25, P2455, DOI 10.1093/RFS/HHS071; DULEEP HO, 1992, IND RELAT, V31, P416, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-232X.1992.TB00318.X; EVERETT CR., 2008, WORKING PAPER; FERNANDEZ M, 1998, SOCIOL PERSPECT, V41, P119, DOI 10.2307/1389356; FERRAN C, 2008, MANAGE SCI, V54, P1565, DOI 10.1287/MNSC.1080.0879; FIDELL B.G., 2007, USING MULTIVARIATE S; FLETSCHNER D, 2009, WORLD DEV, V37, P618, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2008.08.005; FRANKFORTER SA, 1996, J SOC BEHAV PERS, V11, P121; GE Y, 2007, J BANK FINANC, V31, P513, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2006.07.009; GREINER ME, 2010, INT J ELECTRON COMM, V15, P105, DOI 10.2753/JEC1086-4415150204; HAN S, 2004, J REAL ESTATE FINANC, V29, P5, DOI 10.1023/B:REAL.0000027199.22889.65; HERZENSTEIN M, 2011, J INTERACT MARK, V25, P27, DOI 10.1016/J.INTMAR.2010.07.001; IGBARIA M, 1995, MIS QUART, V19, P107, DOI 10.2307/249713; JACCARD J., 2003, INTERACTION EFFECTS; JAPPELLI T, 1990, Q J ECON, V105, P219, DOI 10.2307/2937826; KLAPPER LF, 2011, WORLD BANK RES OBSER, V26, P237, DOI 10.1093/WBRO/LKP032; KUHN P, 2013, Q J ECON, V128, P287, DOI 10.1093/QJE/QJS046; LEE E, 2012, ELECTRON COMMER R A, V11, P495, DOI 10.1016/J.ELERAP.2012.02.001; LIN M., 2009, WORKING PAPER; LIN MF, 2013, MANAGE SCI, V59, P17, DOI 10.1287/MNSC.1120.1560; LIU D, 2015, MIS QUART, V39, P729, DOI 10.25300/MISQ/2015/39.3.11; LUKE D.

EXAMINATION OF GLOBAL DATA SHOWS THAT GOVERNMENT BANKS WITH POLITICALLY CONNECTED CEOS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LOAN DEFAULT RATES AND WORSE OPERATING PERFORMANCE DURING THE CRISIS THAN THOSE WITHOUT POLITICALLY CONNECTED CEOS. HOWEVER, THESE POLITICALLY CONNECTED CEOS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO BE PENALIZED FOR THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF THEIR BANKS. OUR EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT POLITICALLY CONNECTED CEOS OF GOVERNMENT BANKS CAN INFLUENCE A BANK'S LENDING DECISIONS BY USING THEIR POLITICAL POWER AND INFLUENCE TO RELAX LENDING STANDARDS AND TO REAP PRIVATE BENEFITS THAT THUS RAISE THEIR BANKS' SENSITIVITY TO A CRISIS.

WE FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF THE SAMPLE (53.21%) USED CREDIT, AND ONLY 19.77% USED FORMAL CREDIT.

FINDINGS - MFIS ARE CAPABLE OF REACHING OUT TO THE EVEN POORER HOUSEHOLDS IF THEY DEVELOP THE LOAN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE INCOME AND EXPENDITURE FLOWS OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/ IMPLICATIONS - THE DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT RATIONING BY THREE TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS ARE ESTIMATED SEPARATELY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - RCCS IN CHINA SHALL CHANGE THEIR POLICY OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FEMALE- HEADED HOUSEHOLDS. RCCS SHALL ALSO SIMPLIFY THE LOAN APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND ASSESS THE CLIENTS BASED ON THEIR REPAYMENT CAPACITIES RATHER THAN THE AGE OR ASSETS ALONE. RCCS COULD LEARN FROM MFIS TO USE INCOMES FROM MIGRANT WORKERS AS A CRITERION TO ASSESS THE LOAN APPLICANTS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - GENDER EQUITY FOR LOAN ACCESS.

THESE RESULTS UNDERPIN THE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND THE NEED FOR ITS PROMOTION ACROSS COUNTRIES.","[CHURCHILL, SEFA AWAWORYI] RMIT UNIV, SCH ECON FINANCE & MKT, MELBOURNE, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; [MARISETTY, VIJAYA BHASKAR] UNIV HYDERABAD, SCH MANAGEMENT STUDIES, HYDERABAD, INDIA.","CHURCHILL, SA (REPRINT AUTHOR), RMIT UNIV, SCH ECON FINANCE & MKT, MELBOURNE, VIC, AUSTRALIA.","SEFA.CHURCHILL@RMIT.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"AIDEYAN O., 2009, SAVINGS DEV, V33, P293; AKHTER S, 2009, EMERG MARK REV, V10, P191, DOI 10.1016/J.EMEMAR.2009.02.005; ALKIRE S., 2010, 201011 UN DEV PROGR, DOI [10.2139/SSRN.1815243, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.1815243]; ANG JB, 2010, SOUTH ECON J, V76, P738, DOI 10.4284/SEJ.2010.76.3.738; ASHRAF N, 2010, WORLD DEV, V38, P333, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2009.05.010; BANERJEE A, 2015, AM ECON J-APPL ECON, V7, P22, DOI 10.1257/APP.20130533; BANGA R., 2013, HUMAN CAPITAL DEV IN, P77; BECK T, 2008, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V40, P1379, DOI 10.1111/J.1538-4616.2008.00164.X; BECK T, 2007, J ECON GROWTH, V12, P27, DOI 10.1007/S10887-007-9010-6; BECK T, 2006, J BANK FINANC, V30, P2931, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2006.05.009; BECK T, 2008, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V22, P383, DOI 10.1093/WBER/LHN021; BELL C, 2001, J DEV ECON, V65, P153, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(01)00132-8; BINSWANGER HP, 1995, J DEV STUD, V32, P234, DOI 10.1080/00220389508422413; BRUHN M, 2014, J FINANC, V69, P1347, DOI 10.1111/JOFI.12091; BURGESS R, 2005, J EUR ECON ASSOC, V3, P268, DOI 10.1162/JEEA.2005.3.2-3.268; BURGESS R, 2005, AM ECON REV, V95, P780, DOI 10.1257/0002828054201242; CALIENDO M, 2008, J ECON SURV, V22, P31, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6419.2007.00527.X; CARTER MR, 2006, J DEV STUD, V42, P178, DOI 10.1080/00220380500405261; CASTALDO A., 2012, INTERNAL MIGRATION R; CHAKRAVARTY SR, 2013, J POLICY MODEL, V35, P813, DOI 10.1016/J.JPOLMOD.2012.12.007; CHIBBA M, 2009, EUR J DEV RES, V21, P213, DOI 10.1057/EJDR.2008.17; CHURCHILL SA, 2017, SOC INDIC RES, V132, P313, DOI 10.1007/S11205-015-1220-2; CHURCHILL SA, 2017, WORLD DEV, V95, P285, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2017.02.032; CLARKE GRG, 2006, SOUTH ECON J, V72, P578, DOI 10.2307/20111834; COLE S, 2009, REV ECON STAT, V91, P33, DOI 10.1162/REST.91.1.33; DE HAAN J, 2017, EUR J POLIT ECON, V50, P171, DOI 10.1016/J.EJPOLECO.2017.04.007; DEHEJIA RH, 2002, REV ECON STAT, V84, P151, DOI 10.1162/003465302317331982; DEMIRGUC-KUNT A., 2015, 7255 WORLD BANK; DERCON S, 2005, INSURANCE POVERTY, P9; DERCON S., 2007, CTR STUDY AFRICAN EC, V265; DEY S., 2015, MIGRATION DEV, V4, P185, DOI DOI 10.1080/21632324.2014.979022; DIMOVA R, 2018, J DEV STUD, V54, P1534, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2017.1371293; GHOSH S, 2017, WORLD DEV, V92, P60, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2016.11.011; GUNTHER M.

VARIABILITY IN BANKS' FINANCIAL HEALTH FOLLOWING THE 2008 CRISIS IS USED AS AN EXOGENOUS DETERMINANT OF FIRMS' ACCESS TO CREDIT. FINDINGS, RELATIVE TO THE BELGIAN ECONOMY, CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THAT CREDIT MATTERS. THEY SHOW THAT SMES BORROWING MONEY FROM PRE-CRISIS FINANCIALLY LESS HEALTHY BANKS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY A CREDIT CONSTRAINT AND, IN TURN, TO ADJUST THEIR LABOUR INPUT DOWNWARDS THAN PRE-CRISIS CLIENTS OF MORE HEALTHY BANKS. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST ACROSS TYPES OF LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT WERE DENIED CREDIT, I.E. APPLICATIONS TO FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT OR NEW INVESTMENTS. YET, ESTIMATES ALSO SHOW THAT CREDIT CONSTRAINTS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL FOR EMPLOYMENT AMONG SMES EXPERIENCING A NEGATIVE DEMAND SHOCK OR FACING STRONG PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION.

AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE FRAMEWORK IN GHANA'S RURAL BANKING PROGRAMS SHOWS THAT DEMAND AGGREGATION ADVANTAGE PREDICTS CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH THE INCLUSIVE LENDING PRACTICES OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AMONG EXISTING CLIENTS BUT NOT NEW CLIENTS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE STUDY IS CONDUCTED IN ASSAM, INDIA AND USES A QUASI-EXPERIMENT DESIGN TO GATHER PRIMARY DATA. ECONOMETRIC TOOLS LIKE HECKIT PROCEDURE, TOBIT SELECTION EQUATION AND PROBIT MODEL ARE USED FOR EMPIRICAL PURPOSE. FINDINGS THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL WELFARE IS INFLUENCED BY EQUIVALENT FACTORS. IN ADDITION, THE STUDY OBSERVES A LARGER INCIDENCE OF POVERTY AMONG TREATMENT HOUSEHOLDS OF SEMIFORMAL AND INFORMAL BORROWERS. THE STUDY ARGUES THAT FORMAL SOURCES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS BY LIFTING THOSE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE POVERTY LINE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE STUDY INDICATES A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF INCOME AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY AMONG SEMIFORMAL AND INFORMAL BORROWERS. BY TRADITION, AS RURAL ASSAM GETS A DOMINANT ROLE OF TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY-BASED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE SHOULD DEVELOP THE BANKING STRUCTURE BY INVOLVING THESE INSTITUTIONS. THE STUDY EXCLUDES OTHER PROBABLE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES WHILE EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF CREDIT ACCESS ON INCOME AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY, AND THIS LIMITATION IS LEFT TO FUTURE RESEARCH.

POVERTY LEVELS IN THE MEKONG DELTA HAVE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST DECADES, BUT IN THE RURAL AREAS THEY REMAIN SIGNIFICANT. IF IT IS ASSUMED THAT ACCESS TO CREDIT IS A VEHICLE FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSESS HOW HOUSEHOLDS DECIDE ON BORROWING. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES THE DETERMINANTS OF THE DECISION TO BORROW AND OF THE AMOUNT THAT IS BORROWED BY USING THE DOUBLE HURDLE MODEL AND HECKMAN SELECTION MODEL. DATA USED IN THIS PAPER WAS OBTAINED FROM A SURVEY OF 325 RURAL HOUSEHOLDS, CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY AND OCTOBER 2009. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT HOUSEHOLD'S CAPITAL ENDOWMENTS, MARITAL STATUS, FAMILY SIZE, DISTANCE TO THE MARKET CENTER, AND LOCATIONS AFFECT THE PROBABILITY TO ASK FOR AND AMOUNT OF CREDIT.","[VUONG QUOC DUY; D'HAESE, MARIJKE; LEMBA, JACINTA; D'HAESE, LUC] UNIV GHENT, FAC BIOSCI ENGN, DEPT AGR ECON, GHENT, BELGIUM.; [HAU, LE LONG] UNIV ANTWERP, FAC APPL ECON, ANTWERP, BELGIUM.; [D'HAESE, LUC] UNIV ANTWERP, FAC SCI, DEPT BIOENGN, ANTWERP, BELGIUM.","DUY, VQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GHENT, FAC BIOSCI ENGN, DEPT AGR ECON, GHENT, BELGIUM.","DUY.VUONGQUOC@UGENT.BE",NA,NA,"AGRIBANK, 2009, VIETN BANK AGR RUR D; AKOTEN JE, 2006, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V54, P927, DOI 10.1086/503585; ANH NGUYEN NGOC, 2010, THESIS U LIBRE BRUXE; [ANONYMOUS], 2009, SOC TRANG ANN SOC EC; ARMENDARIZ B.A., 2005, ANN REPORT; BARNEY J, 1991, J MANAGE, V17, P99, DOI 10.1177/014920639101700108; BARSLUND M, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P485, DOI 10.1080/00220380801980798; BELL C, 1997, OXFORD ECON PAP, V49, P557, DOI 10.1093/OXFORDJOURNALS.OEP.A028625; BLAYLOCK JR, 1993, APPL ECON, V25, P645, DOI 10.1080/00036849300000009; CAO D.D., 1997, IMPACTS INTEREST RAT; COMMINS STEPHEN, 2001, POVERTY REDUCTION ST; CONNING JONATHAN, 2005, 914 YAL U; CRAGG JG, 1971, ECONOMETRICA, V39, P829, DOI 10.2307/1909582; DARLING MALCOLM L, 1925, PUNJAB PEASANT PROSP; DIAGNE A., 1999, 67 FOOD CONS NUTR DI; DOAN TINH THANH, 2011, THESIS U WAIKATO JAP; DUTTA D, 2006, APPL ECON, V38, P1627, DOI 10.1080/00036840500427148; FLORO S.

THIS STUDY'S RESULTS DO NOT PRODUCE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF GENDER BIAS IN FSA LOAN APPROVAL DECISIONS AND IN FAVOR OF THE ""COMMONALITY"" ARGUMENT AMONG GEORGIA FSA FARM LOAN APPLICANTS.","[ESCALANTE, CESAR L.; EPPERSON, JAMES E.; RAGHUNATHAN, UTHRA] UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT AGR & APPL ECON, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA.","ESCALANTE, CL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GEORGIA, DEPT AGR & APPL ECON, ATHENS, GA 30602 USA.",NA,NA,NA,"ARDALAN K, 2006, J COMMERCIAL BANKING, V5, P25; ARROW KJ, 1973, DISCRIMINATION LABOR, P3; BECKER G., 1971, EC DISCRIMINATION; BENNETT D, 2001, DELTA FARM PRES 0608; BERKOVEC JA, 1994, J REAL ESTATE FINANC, V9, P263, DOI 10.1007/BF01099279; CARTER N, 1997, [NO TITLE CAPTURED]; DUNNE K, 2006, WOMEN FARMERS 0718; DYCKMAN LJ, 2002, PUB US GEN ACCOUNTIN; ESCALANTE C.

THE SEMI-COOPERATIVE HOUSEHOLD MODEL DEVELOPED FOR THIS ANALYSIS FORMALIZES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SPOUSES', AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN'S, INDIVIDUAL ACCESS TO CREDIT CAN BE AFFECTED BY THEIR OWN POSITION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET ITS WELL AS BY INTRAHOUSEHOLD DYNAMICS. THESE NOTIONS ARE THEN EXPLORED EMPIRICALLY USING HUSBANDS' AND WIVES' INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ACCESS TO CREDIT IN RURAL PARAGUAY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EMPIRICAL FINDINGS OF THE PAPER ARE THAT (I) COMPARED TO MEN. WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CREDIT CONSTRAINED (II) WOMEN'S RATIONING STATUS RESPONDS TO A DIFFERENT SET OF FACTORS THAN MEN'S; AND (III) HUSBANDS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO INTERMEDIATE CAPITAL TO THEIR WIVES EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO.

WE DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL FIRM'S POLITICAL CONNECTIONS BY IDENTIFYING WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OWNS SHARES IN THE FIRM, WHETHER POLITICIANS ARE ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND WHETHER HIGHLY-RANKED MANAGERS PERSONALLY KNOW ANY POLITICIAN. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED EFFECTS OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ON FIRMS FINANCING AND PERFORMANCE, WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN LARGE FIRMS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMES), BETWEEN THE LOAN APPROVAL AND AMOUNT SETTING PROCESSES, AND BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. WE FIND THAT POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BORROW FROM STATE-OWNED BANKS. MOREOVER, BEING CONNECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT RAISES THE PROBABILITY THAT A FIRM CAN RECEIVE THE FULL LOAN AMOUNT IT APPLIED FOR. THE IMPROVEMENT IN ACCESS TO FINANCE FROM POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IS MORE PROMINENT FOR SMES THAN FOR LARGE FIRMS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH IMPROVEMENT MOSTLY COMES FROM PERSONAL CONNECTIONS WITH POLITICIANS RATHER THAN MORE FORMAL CONNECTIONS MEASURED BY THE GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OR POLITICIANS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FINALLY, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTED LENDING ON ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY OF CAPITAL AND FIND WEAK EVIDENCE THAT SCARCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE LIKELY CHANNELED BY STATE-OWNED BANKS TO POLITICALLY CONNECTED BUT LESS PRODUCTIVE FIRMS.

FINANCIAL EXCLUSION, I.E., NOT HAVING A FORMAL ACCOUNT, IS MAINLY VOLUNTARY. THE USE OF FORMAL CREDIT IS HOWEVER LESS FREQUENT IN CHINA THAN IN THE OTHER BRICS. BORROWING THROUGH FAMILY OR FRIENDS IS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF OBTAINING CREDIT IN ALL THE BRICS COUNTRIES, BUT OTHER CHANNELS FOR BORROWING ARE NOT VERY COMMONLY USED BY INDIVIDUALS IN CHINA. WE FIND THAT HIGHER INCOME, BETTER EDUCATION, BEING A MAN, AND BEING OLDER ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER USE OF FORMAL ACCOUNTS AND FORMAL CREDIT IN CHINA.

THE EVALUATION OF THE CAUSAL EFFECTS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, IS A DIFFICULT TASK AS THEIR ALLOCATION IS TYPICALLY ENDOGENOUS. TO OVERCOME THIS IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM, WE EXPLOIT A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN THE ALLOCATION OF LAND TITLES. IN 1981, SQUATTERS OCCUPIED A PIECE OF LAND IN A POOR SUBURBAN AREA OF BUENOS AIRES. IN 1984, A LAW WAS PASSED EXPROPRIATING THE FORMER OWNERS' LAND TO ENTITLE THE OCCUPANTS. SOME ORIGINAL OWNERS ACCEPTED THE GOVERNMENT COMPENSATION, WHILE OTHERS DISPUTED THE COMPENSATION PAYMENT IN THE SLOW ARGENTINE COURTS. THESE DIFFERENT DECISIONS BY THE FORMER OWNERS GENERATED AN EXOGENOUS ALLOCATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS ACROSS SQUATTERS. USING DATA FROM TWO SURVEYS PERFORMED IN 2003 AND 2007, WE FIND THAT ENTITLED FAMILIES SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED HOUSING INVESTMENT, REDUCED HOUSEHOLD SIZE, AND ENHANCED THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THESE EFFECTS, HOWEVER, DID NOT TAKE PLACE THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESS TO CREDIT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LAND TITLING CAN BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR POVERTY REDUCTION, ALBEIT NOT THROUGH THE SHORTCUT OF CREDIT ACCESS, BUT THROUGH THE SLOW CHANNEL OF INCREASED PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT, WHICH SHOULD HELP TO REDUCE POVERTY IN FUTURE GENERATIONS.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL CROSS-COUNTRY STUDIES ON THIS ASPECT, FEW WITHIN-COUNTRY STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. IN THIS CONTEXT, EXPLOITING DISAGGREGATED HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL DATA FOR INDIA, WE ANALYZE THE INTERFACE BETWEEN GENDER AND FINANCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINE WHETHER GENDER MATTERS FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND IF SO, WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THIS RELATIONSHIP. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN BOTH THE ACCESS TO AS WELL AS THE USE OF FINANCE BY GENDER. ON AVERAGE, FEMALE HEADED HOUSEHOLDS ARE 8% LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS FORMAL FINANCE AND 6% MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS INFORMAL FINANCE AS COMPARED TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE HEADED BY MALES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OTHER RELEVANT HOUSEHOLD AND STATE-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING FINANCIAL ACCESS BY HOUSEHOLDS. SIMILAR EVIDENCE CARRIES OVER TO THE USE OF FINANCE: HOUSEHOLDS HEADED BY FEMALE USE 20% LESS CASH LOANS AS COMPARED TO MALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBLE CHANNELS WHICH IMPEDE FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR FEMALE -HEADED HOUSEHOLDS. OUR ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THAT FOR FEMALE -HEADED HOUSEHOLDS, EDUCATION AND WAGES ARE MORE RELEVANT IN EXPLAINING THE ACCESS TO FINANCE WHEREAS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS ARE MUCH MORE GERMANE IN EXPLAINING THE USE OF FINANCE.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT MAKES INDIVIDUALS APPEAR SELF-CONFIDENT AT WORK. WE DRAW ON ATTRIBUTION AND SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS LITERATURE TO THEORIZE ABOUT BOTH ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF APPEARING SELF-CONFIDENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT PERFORMANCE IS ONE DETERMINANT OF WHETHER INDIVIDUALS ARE SEEN AS CONFIDENT AT WORK AND THAT THIS EFFECT IS MODERATED BY GENDER. WE FURTHER PROPOSE THAT SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE INCREASES THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS EXERT INFLUENCE IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. HOWEVER, FOR WOMEN, APPEARING SELF-CONFIDENT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GAIN INFLUENCE. IN CONTRAST TO MEN, WOMEN IN ADDITION ARE ""REQUIRED"" TO BE PROSOCIALLY ORIENTED. MULTISOURCE, TIME-LAG DATA FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL COMPANY SHOWED THAT PERFORMANCE HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE ON ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCE WAS MODERATED BY GENDER AND PROSOCIAL ORIENTATION, AS PREDICTED. THROUGH SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE, JOB PERFORMANCE DIRECTLY ENABLED MEN TO EXERT INFLUENCE IN THEIR ORGANIZATION. IN CONTRAST, HIGH-PERFORMING WOMEN GAINED INFLUENCE ONLY WHEN THEIR SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE WAS COUPLED WITH PROSOCIAL ORIENTATION. OUR RESULTS HAVE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR GENDER EQUALITY AND LEADERSHIP. THEY SUGGEST THAT HR AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SHOULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN BUILDING MORE DIVERSITY-FRIENDLY ORGANIZATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, ENSURING THAT THE SAME JOB REQUIREMENTS-EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT-ARE APPLIED TO BOTH FEMALE AND MALE EMPLOYEES IS CRUCIAL FOR FAIR INDIVIDUAL OUTCOMES IN ORGANIZATIONS.","[GUILLEN, LAURA] EUROPEAN SCH MANAGEMENT & TECHNOL, SCHLOSSPL 1, D-10178 BERLIN, GERMANY.; [MAYO, MARGARITA] IE BUSINESS SCH, LEADERSHIP, MADRID, SPAIN.; [KARELAIA, NATALIA] INSEAD, FONTAINEBLEAU, FRANCE.","GUILLEN, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), EUROPEAN SCH MANAGEMENT & TECHNOL, SCHLOSSPL 1, D-10178 BERLIN, GERMANY.","LAURA.GUILLEN@ESMT.ORG",NA,NA,"ABELE AE, 2007, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V93, P751, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.93.5.751; ANDERSON C, 2009, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V96, P491, DOI 10.1037/A0014201; ANGWIN J., 1998, SAN FRANCISCO CHRON, P4; ANTONAKIS J, 2010, LEADERSHIP QUART, V21, P1086, DOI 10.1016/J.LEAQUA.2010.10.010; ARVEY RD, 1998, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V49, P141, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.49.1.141; ASTIN AW, 1997, AM FRESHMAN 30 YEAR; ATWATER LE, 2002, HUM RESOURCE MANAGE, V41, P193, DOI 10.1002/HRM.10031; AWAMLEH R, 1999, LEADERSHIP QUART, V10, P345, DOI 10.1016/S1048-9843(99)00022-3; BAKAN D., 1966, DUALITY HUMAN EXISTE; BANDURA A., 1977, SOCIAL LEARNING THEO; BANDURA A., 1997, SELF EFFICACY EXERCI; BASS BM, 1990, ORGAN DYN, V18, P19, DOI 10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S; BAUER DJ, 2005, MULTIVAR BEHAV RES, V40, P373, DOI 10.1207/S15327906MBR4003_5; BAUER RA, 1964, AM PSYCHOL, V19, P319, DOI 10.1037/H0042851; BECKER TE, 2005, ORGAN RES METHODS, V8, P274, DOI 10.1177/1094428105278021; BENTLER PM, 1996, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V47, P563, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.47.1.563; BIDDLE B, 1979, ROLE THEORY EXPECTAT; BIERNAT M, 1997, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V72, P544, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.544; BOLLEN KA, 1989, SOCIOL METHOD RES, V17, P303, DOI 10.1177/0049124189017003004; BORMAN WC, 1997, HUM RESOUR MANAGE R, V7, P299, DOI 10.1016/S1053-4822(97)90010-3; BORMAN WC, 1993, PERSONNEL SELECTION, V71, P71, DOI DOI 10.1007/SPRINGERREFERENCE_7472; CARLI LL, 1995, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V68, P1030, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.68.6.1030; CARLI LL, 2001, J SOC ISSUES, V57, P725, DOI 10.1111/0022-4537.00238; CARLI LL, 1990, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V59, P941, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941; CASCIARO T, 2008, ADMIN SCI QUART, V53, P655, DOI 10.2189/ASQU.53.4.655; CASTELLS M., 1999, INFORM TECHNOLOGY GL, V114; CATALYST, 2015, WOM MAL IND OCC; CATALYST, 2016, WOM S P 500 CO; CECH EA, 2010, SOC PROBL, V57, P371, DOI 10.1525/SP.2010.57.3.371; CHERYAN S, 2017, PSYCHOL BULL, V143, P1, DOI 10.1037/BUL0000052; CITRIN J, 1986, BRIT J POLIT SCI, V16, P431, DOI 10.1017/S0007123400004518; CONGER JA, 1987, ACAD MANAGE REV, V12, P637, DOI 10.2307/258069; CORRELL S., 2016, HARVARD BUSINESS REV; CRAIG S.

SO, IT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO STUDY THE REASONS WHY SMES ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO CREDIT CONSTRAINTS. BY CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN SMES AND LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES, WE ESTABLISHED A THEORETICAL MODEL WITH ENDOGENOUS ENTERPRISE SIZE, AND BY CONSIDERING BANKS' SCREENING PRINCIPLES BEFORE AND AFTER THE LOAN APPROVAL, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE MICRO-MECHANISM IN WHICH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT AVAILABILITY BETWEEN SMES AND LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES. OUR CONCLUSION INDICATES THAT CREDIT RATIONING IN SMES IS THE RESULT OF THE RATIONAL CHOICE BY BANKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROFIT MAXIMIZATION.","[JIN, YUHUAN; ZHANG, SHENG] XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH PUBL POLICY & ADM, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.","JIN, YH; ZHANG, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH PUBL POLICY & ADM, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.","YUHUANJIN628@STU.XJTU.EDU.CN; ZHANGSHENG@STU.XJTU.EDU.CN","POLICY RESEARCH ON ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN SHAANXI PROVINCE [2016KRZ003]","POLICY RESEARCH ON ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN SHAANXI PROVINCE: 2016KRZ003.","ATIENO ROSEMARY, 2001, 111 AFR EC RES CONS; AZIZ J., 2002, IMF WORK PAPER, DOI [10.5089/9781451859874.001, DOI 10.5089/9781451859874.001]; BALTENSPERGER E, 1978, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V10, P170, DOI 10.2307/1991869; BANERJEE A.V., 2008, SOC SCI ELECT PUBLIS, V81, P572; BANERJEE A, 2015, AM ECON J-APPL ECON, V7, P22, DOI 10.1257/APP.20130533; BAUMOL W.J., 2009, SOC SCI ELECT PUBL, V58, P64; BECK T, 2005, J FINANC, V60, P137, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.2005.00727.X; BECK T, 2004, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V36, P627, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2004.0039; BECK T, 2006, J INT MONEY FINANC, V25, P932, DOI 10.1016/J.JIMONFIN.2006.07.005; BELONGIA MT, 1990, AM J AGR ECON, V72, P769, DOI 10.2307/1243053; CHAN YS, 1985, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V17, P84, DOI 10.2307/1992508; COASE RH, 1937, ECONOMICA-NEW SER, V4, P386, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-0335.1937.TB00002.X; DANG CY, 2018, J BANK FINANC, V86, P159, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2017.09.006; DEMIRGUC-KUNT A, 1998, J FINANC, V53, P2107, DOI 10.1111/0022-1082.00084; DEMIRGUCKUNT A., 2010, POLICY RES WORK PAP, V22, P483; DOH S, 2014, RES POLICY, V43, P1557, DOI 10.1016/J.RESPOL.2014.05.001; GELOS RG, 2002, J DEV ECON, V67, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(01)00175-4; GOU Q, 2014, J FINANC RES, V8, P1; GROSSMAN SJ, 1986, J POLIT ECON, V94, P691, DOI 10.1086/261404; GUAN JC, 2009, RES POLICY, V38, P802, DOI 10.1016/J.RESPOL.2008.12.009; GUAN JC, 2015, RES POLICY, V44, P273, DOI 10.1016/J.RESPOL.2014.09.001; HALME M, 2014, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V23, P547, DOI 10.1002/BSE.1801; HUGHES A., 2000, 180 U CAMBR ESRC CTR; JIANCHENG GUAN, 2002, PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, V43, P30; JIN XL, 2015, BIG DATA RES, V2, P59, DOI 10.1016/J.BDR.2015.01.006; KARNANI A., 2007, RETRIEV FEBR, V18, P2009; KELLOGG C.

CONTRARY TO PRIOR RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SMALL OR MICROLOANS PRIMARILY BENEFIT ENTREPRENEURS WHO EXPERIENCE DISADVANTAGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, THE FINDINGS REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN LOAN SOURCE OR LOAN AMOUNT BY GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE FIRM. THE FINDINGS DID REVEAL, HOWEVER, THAT THE MOTIVATIONS (PUSH VS PULL) OF THE ENTREPRENEUR WERE A DETERMINANT OF LOAN SOURCE. FROM THIS, THE AUTHORS BEGIN TO DEVELOP A THEORY OF FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT SMALL LOANS SECURED AT KEY POINTS IN TIME CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON FIRM PERFORMANCE FOR ALL TYPES OF ENTREPRENEURS, NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY BE CLASSIFIED AS ""DISADVANTAGED."" DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DATA FOR THIS STUDY WAS TAKEN FROM THE PANEL STUDY ON ENTREPRENEURIAL DYNAMICS (PSED II). THE AUTHORS FOCUSSED ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MEASURES OVER THE SIX YEARS OF THAT STUDY TO REASSESS EXISTING FINDINGS ON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MICROFINANCE AND UNDERPERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY AMONG WOMEN, ETHNIC AND UNEMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS, FROM A FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE PERSPECTIVE. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SMALL OR MICROLOANS ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OVER TIME BY TRACKING THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL SOURCES, AMOUNT OF MONEY BORROWED, BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS, AND MOTIVATION TO START A BUSINESS (I.E. PUSH OR PULL). FINDINGS - THE RESULTS ALSO REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BY GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS IN THE SOURCE OF AMOUNTS OF SMALL LOANS SECURED DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BUSINESSES. THUS, CONSISTENT WITH THE THEORY OF FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE, ALL TYPES OF ENTREPRENEURS ENGAGED IN SEEKING OUT SMALL LOANS DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THEIR BUSINESSES' EXISTENCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - ALTHOUGH USING THE PSED II HAS MANY ADVANTAGES, IT IS NOT PROTECTED FROM METHODOLOGICAL PITFALLS. ONE SUCH POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGE IS THE FACT THAT THIS DATABASE ALLOWS THE AUTHORS TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF US-BASED NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS, BUT OVERLOOKS OTHER COUNTRIES. FUTURE RESEARCH EFFORTS SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON SURVEYING NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND CULTURES TO EXPAND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN SMALL LOANS AND FINANCIAL SOURCES ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE WORLDWIDE. THIS COULD BE MOST USEFUL FOR INTENSIFYING RESEARCH IN REGIONS THAT GENERATE MORE PUSH AND/OR PULL ENTREPRENEURS. A SECOND DISADVANTAGE INHERENT IN THE PSED IS THAT INTERVIEWS IN FOLLOW-UP SURVEYS MAY HAVE BECOME IMPOSSIBLE OVER TIME, RESULTING IN MISSING DATA. IN ADDITION, THE REASONS FOR BEING UNABLE TO REACH INTERVIEWEES ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEAR. IN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL REALM, THESE REASONS HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BUSINESSES. INTERVIEWEES' BUSINESSES MAY HAVE GONE BANKRUPT, MERGED WITH OTHER FIRMS AND THUS CHANGED CONTACT DETAILS, GONE GLOBAL AND THEREFORE LEFT THE COUNTRY, ETC. (DELMAR AND SHANE, 2003); THESE COULD BIAS THE RESULTS. A FINAL POTENTIAL WEAKNESS IN THE PSED IS THAT THE DATA ARE BASED ON ENTREPRENEURS' SELF-REPORTS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE PRONE TO MANY KINDS OF RESPONSE BIAS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - BY OFFERING PRACTICAL EDUCATION AIMED AT ENHANCING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ENTREPRENEURS, THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN MEET THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE RESEARCH (E.G. DU RIETZ AND HENREKSON, 2000; PARKER, 2004; PFEIFFER AND REIZE, 2000; REYNOLDS ET AL., 2002) ON PERFORMANCE GAPS BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURS WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS AND THOSE EMBARKING ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS (PUSH VS PULL). IN LINE WITH THE FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE THEORY, THE RESULTS MAY AID GOVERNMENTAL BODIES, EDUCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ORIENTED TOWARD ENTREPRENEURS, AND SMALL BUSINESSES, IN CONSTRUCTING PROGRAMS THAT WILL TRAIN ENTREPRENEURS TO BE ATTENTIVE TO THE DIVERSE RANGE OF POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES, INCLUDING SMALL LOANS AND DIFFERENT FINANCIAL SOURCES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE RESEARCH CHALLENGES THE NECESSITY-OPPORTUNITY SIMPLISTIC CATEGORIZATION AND BUILDS UPON PRIOR WORK IN THE FIELD OF BRICOLAGE, OR THE PRACTICE OF ""MAKING DO WITH WHATEVER IS AT HAND,"" TO BEGIN DEVELOPING A THEORY OF ""FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE."" IT IS THE CONTENTION THAT ALL NEW BUSINESSES ARE RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED DUE TO CHALLENGES POSED BY ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION. THUS, NEW BUSINESSES, IN GENERAL, DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A FULL RANGE OF FUNDING ALTERNATIVES.

THE RATIONALE HAS BEEN THAT SUCH BUSINESSES SHARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH TYPES OF OWNERS AND WOULD CONFOUND ANY GENDER-BASED DIFFERENCES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN WHICH THE CREDIT ACCESS EXPERIENCES OF EQUALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OF THEIR FEMALE- AND MALE-OWNED ENTREPRENEURIAL COUNTERPARTS. VARIOUS MEASURES OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ARE INTRODUCED THAT SUGGEST THAT EQUALLY OWNED BUSINESSES OFTEN DO EXPERIENCE LARGER CONSTRAINTS THAN MALE-OWNED BUSINESSES AND SMALLER CONSTRAINTS THAN FEMALE-OWNED BUSINESSES, WHEN ALL CREDIT APPLICANTS ARE CONSIDERED. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS ARE MORE MIXED IN COMPARISONS OF SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS' CONSTRAINTS. A DIFFERENT APPROACH FROM THAT OF EXISTING RESEARCH IS THEN USED TO STUDY EXACTLY HOW EQUALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES' EXPERIENCES ARE UNIQUE, RATHER THAN MERELY WHETHER THEY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS. THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE DETERMINING THE CREDIT APPLICATION OUTCOMES OF ALL THREE OWNERSHIP GROUPS. WHERE SIMILAR DETERMINANTS ARE FOUND, EQUALLY OWNED BUSINESSES ARE INFLUENCED IN A MANNER MORE SIMILAR TO MALE-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EQUALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES' CREDIT ACCESS EXPERIENCE IS NOT EQUALLY BALANCED BETWEEN THOSE OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS.","UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT SOCIAL SCI ECON, DEARBORN, MI 48128 USA.","KIM, GO (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT SOCIAL SCI ECON, DEARBORN, MI 48128 USA.",NA,NA,NA,"APILADO V., 1992, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V30, P38; AVALLUZZO K, 2002, FINANCE EC DISCUSSIO, P1; BATES T, 1991, Q REV ECON BUS, V31, P64; BITLER MP, 2001, FINANCIAL RESERVE B, P183; BLANCHFLOWER DG, 1998, NBER WORKING PAPER W, V6840; BRUSH C.G., 1992, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V16, P5, DOI DOI 10.1177/104225879201600401; BUTTNER EH, 1988, J BUS VENTURING, V3, P249, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(88)90018-3; BUTTNER EH, 1989, J BUS VENTURING, V4, P249, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(89)90015-3; BUTTNER EH, 1992, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V30, P58; CARTER S., 1998, ENTREP REGION DEV, V10, P225, DOI DOI 10.1080/08985629800000013; CAVALLUZZO KS, 2002, J BUS, V75, P641, DOI 10.1086/341638; CAVALLUZZO KS, 1998, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V30, P771, DOI 10.2307/2601128; CHOW CKW, 2000, J BUS VENTURING, V15, P363, DOI 10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00014-7; COKER J.

THE STUDY AIMS TO EXTEND THIS TO EXAMINE IF A PURE GENDER EFFECT EXISTS OR WHETHER IT IS THE INTERACTION OF GENDER WITH DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC AND PERCEPTUAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT PLAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PERCEPTION OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DATA WITHIN THIS STUDY ARE DRAWN FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) ADULT POPULATION SURVEY BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007. THE FIRST STAGE OF THE STUDY SPLITS MALE AND FEMALE RESPONDENTS INTO SEPARATE SUB-SAMPLES AND RUNS INDIVIDUAL REGRESSIONS ON EACH PORTION OF THE SAMPLE. THE SECOND STAGE OF THE STUDY COMBINES THE MALE AND FEMALE PORTIONS OF THE SAMPLE TO DIRECTLY EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES IN PERCEIVED FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT BETWEEN GENDERS. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A GREATER PROPORTION OF WOMEN ARE SOLELY CONSTRAINED BY FINANCIAL BARRIERS THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. THE GENDER OF THE RESPONDENT WAS ALSO FOUND TO INTERACT WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A SIGNIFICANT MANNER. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO MARKET THE AVAILABILITY OF START-UP FINANCE FROM VARIOUS SOURCES TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCE RATHER THAN BEING DISCOURAGED AT THE FIRST HURDLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - ALTHOUGH ACTUAL FINANCIAL BARRIERS FACED BY FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED, THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES TO FOCUS ON THE CONCEPT OF PERCEIVED FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS FACED BY POTENTIAL FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS.","[KWONG, CALEB] UNIV ESSEX, ENTREPRENEURSHIP & INNOVAT GRP, SOUTHEND ON SEA, ENGLAND.; [JONES-EVANS, DYLAN] UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF, ENTERPRISE & INNOVAT, CARDIFF, S GLAM, WALES.; [THOMPSON, PIERS] CARDIFF METROPOLITAN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING ECON & FINANCE, CARDIFF, WALES.","KWONG, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESSEX, ENTREPRENEURSHIP & INNOVAT GRP, SOUTHEND ON SEA, ENGLAND.","CKWONG@ESSEX.AC.UK",NA,NA,"AJZEN I, 1991, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V50, P179, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T; ALDRICH H.

THE FACT THAT MINORITIES HAVE HIGHER DEFAULT RATES ON AVERAGE THAN WHITES IS IRRELEVANT TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RACE COEFFICIENT IN SUCH MODELS. NONETHELESS, MORE RESEARCH ON AND DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RACE OF THE APPLICANT AND DELINQUENCIES, DEFAULTS, AND LOSSES WOULD BE DESIRABLE.","DUKE UNIV, SANFORD INST PUBL POLICY, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA.","LADD, HF (REPRINT AUTHOR), DUKE UNIV, SANFORD INST PUBL POLICY, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA.","LADD@PPS.DUKE.EDU",NA,NA,"ARROW KJ, 1973, DISCRIMINATION LABOR, P3; BECKER G, 1993, BUSINESS WEEK 0419; BECKER G., 1971, EC DISCRIMINATION; BENSTON GJ, 1991, J FINANCIAL SERVICES, V5, P235; BERKOVEC J, 1995, DISCRIMINATION DEFAU; BERKOVEC J., 1996, CITYSCAPE J POLICY D, V2, P9; BERKOVEC J.

THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON A UNIQUE DATASET OF MANUFACTURING FIRMS THAT COVERS DOZENS OF DEVELOPING AND TRANSITION COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE FIRM'S SENIOR MANAGERS SPEND WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CREDIT ACCESS. EXPLOITING THE CROSS-COUNTRY DIMENSION OF THE DATASET, I THEN SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IS HIGHER IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE BANKING SECTOR IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND HAS HIGHER NET INTEREST MARGIN. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IS LOWER IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CREDIT INFORMATION SHARING MECHANISMS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A COMPETITIVE BANKING SECTOR IMPROVES EFFICIENCY OF CREDIT ALLOCATION BY REDUCING POLITICALLY MOTIVATED LENDING.","UNIV GRONINGEN, NL-9700 AV GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.","LASHITEW, AA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GRONINGEN, POB 800, NL-9700 AV GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.","A.A.LASHITEW@RUG.NL",NA,NA,"ABIAD A, 2008, J DEV ECON, V87, P270, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2007.12.002; AI CR, 2003, ECON LETT, V80, P123, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00032-6; AMEMIYA T, 1984, J ECONOMETRICS, V24, P3, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(84)90074-5; BANERJEE AV, 2005, HANDB ECON, V22, P473; BARTH J.R., 2008, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V4646; BECK T, 2004, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V36, P627, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2004.0039; BECK T, 2010, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V24, P77, DOI 10.1093/WBER/LHP016; BRANDT L, 2003, J COMP ECON, V31, P387, DOI 10.1016/S0147-5967(03)00080-5; BROWN M, 2009, J FINANC INTERMED, V18, P151, DOI 10.1016/J.JFI.2008.04.002; CETORELLI N, 2001, J FINANC, V56, P617, DOI 10.1111/0022-1082.00339; CLAESSENS S, 2008, J FINANC ECON, V88, P554, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.11.003; DJANKOV S, 2007, J FINANC ECON, V84, P299, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.03.004; DU J, 2010, KYKLOS, V63, P530, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6435.2010.00486.X; FACCIO M, 2006, AM ECON REV, V96, P369, DOI 10.1257/000282806776157704; FIRTH M, 2009, J BANK FINANC, V33, P1144, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2008.12.008; FRYE TM, 2011, EUR J POLIT ECON, V27, P642, DOI 10.1016/J.EJPOLECO.2011.06.003; GONZALEZ-PARAMO JM, 2005, KYKLOS, V58, P495, DOI 10.1111/J.0023-5962.2005.00299.X; GREENE W, 2010, ECON LETT, V107, P291, DOI 10.1016/J.ECONLET.2010.02.014; HSIEH CT, 2009, Q J ECON, V124, P1403, DOI 10.1162/QJEC.2009.124.4.1403; HUBBARD RG, 1998, J ECON LIT, V36, P193; KALI R, 1999, J LAW ECON ORGAN, V15, P615, DOI 10.1093/JLEO/15.3.615; KHWAJA AI, 2005, Q J ECON, V120, P1371, DOI 10.1162/003355305775097524; LA PORTA R, 2002, J FINANC, V57, P265, DOI 10.1111/1540-6261.00422; LAMBSDORFF JG, 2003, KYKLOS, V56, P457, DOI 10.1046/J.0023-5962.2003.00233.X; LI HB, 2008, J DEV ECON, V87, P283, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2007.03.001; LI HB, 2006, ECON INQ, V44, P559, DOI 10.1093/EI/CBJ031; MEGGINSON WL, 2005, J BANK FINANC, V29, P1931, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2005.03.005; SCHIANTARELLI FABIO, 1995, BOSTON COLL WORKING, V293; WURGLER J, 2000, J FINANC ECON, V58, P187, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(00)00070-2","29",3,"3","0","14","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0023-5962","1467-6435","KYKLOS","KYKLOS","10.1111/KYKL.12051",NA,"28","ECONOMICS","BUSINESS & ECONOMICS","AI9TG","ISI000337279300005","2020-02-17","","MAY",2014,"67","2","227","254",NA,NA,NA,"LASHITEW, ADDISU/K-7625-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ISI","UNIV GRONINGEN","UNIV GRONINGEN",NA,"LASHITEW AA, 2014, KYKLOS"

OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE THAT BANK LENDING DECISIONS ARE DISTORTED FOR PRINCELING-BACKED FIRMS DUE TO THE PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTIONS THEY CAN OBTAIN FROM THE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH PRINCELINGS' FAMILY TIES. MOREOVER, WE FIND THAT, DUE TO EXCESS LONG-TERM BANK LOANS, PRINCELING-BACKED NON-SOES TEND TO OVERINVEST, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN LOWER INVESTMENT EFFICIENCY. FURTHERMORE, WE USE THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE METHOD TO CAPTURE THE EFFECT OF THE EXOGENOUS SHOCK OF THE RECENT ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN IN CHINA ON PRINCELINGS AND CORPORATE FINANCE AND INVESTMENT.

OVERALL, OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT BY DISTORTING BANK LENDING DECISIONS AND ENCOURAGING OVER-INVESTMENT, THE INVOLVEMENT OF PRINCELINGS IN FIRMS CAUSES RESOURCE MISALLOCATION WHICH FAVOURS PRINCELING-BACKED FIRMS AND DISCOURAGES INVESTMENT IN NON-PRINCELING-BACKED FIRMS.","[LI, QING; MA, SHIGUANG] UNIV WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, NSW, AUSTRALIA.; [LIU, QIGUI] ZHEJIANG UNIV, HANGZHOU, ZHEJIANG, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [TIAN, GARY GANG] MACQUARIE UNIV, N RYDE, NSW, AUSTRALIA.","MA, SG (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WOLLONGONG, WOLLONGONG, NSW, AUSTRALIA.","QINGLI@UOW.EDU.AU; QIGUI@ZJU.EDU.CN; SHIGUANG@UOW.EDU.AU; GARY.TIAN@MAFC.MQ.EDU.AU",NA,NA,"BARBOZA D, 2012, NEW YORK TIMES 0424, PA1; BENNEDSEN M, 2006, J PUBLIC ECON, V90, P631, DOI 10.1016/J.JPUBECO.2005.08.003; BERKMAN H, 2010, J FINANC QUANT ANAL, V45, P1391, DOI 10.1017/S0022109010000608; BLAU BM, 2013, J BANK FINANC, V37, P3007, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2013.04.005; BOUBAKRI N, 2012, J CORP FINANC, V18, P541, DOI 10.1016/J.JCORPFIN.2012.02.005; BOUBAKRI N, 2011, J CORP FINANC, V17, P244, DOI 10.1016/J.JCORPFIN.2010.08.003; BURKART M, 2003, J FINANC, V58, P2167, DOI 10.1111/1540-6261.00601; CHEN CJP, 2011, J CORP FINANC, V17, P229, DOI 10.1016/J.JCORPFIN.2010.09.009; CHEN DH, 2017, J BANK FINANC, V76, P15, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2016.11.023; CHEN SM, 2011, J CORP FINANC, V17, P259, DOI 10.1016/J.JCORPFIN.2010.08.004; CHEN T, 2019, Q J ECON, V134, P185, DOI 10.1093/QJE/QJY027; CHEUNG YL, 2010, REV FINANC, V14, P669, DOI 10.1093/ROF/RFP024; CLAESSENS S, 2008, J FINANC ECON, V88, P554, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.11.003; COHEN LH, 2010, HARVARD BUS REV, V88, P34; CULL R, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V77, P117, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.05.010; DE SOTO H., 1989, OTHER PATH INVISIBLE; DRAZEN A, 2007, J PUBLIC ECON, V91, P723, DOI 10.1016/J.JPUBECO.2006.10.005; FACCIO M, 2006, J FINANC, V61, P2597, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.2006.01000.X; FACCIO M, 2010, FINANC MANAGE, V39, P905, DOI 10.1111/J.1755-053X.2010.01099.X; FAN JPH, 2008, J COMP ECON, V36, P343, DOI 10.1016/J.JCE.2008.05.001; FAN JPH, 2007, J FINANC ECON, V84, P330, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.03.008; FERRIS SP, 2019, FINAN REV, V54, P57, DOI 10.1111/FIRE.12181; FISMAN R, 2001, AM ECON REV, V91, P1095, DOI 10.1257/AER.91.4.1095; GARY S., 2014, AUST J MANAGE, V10, P1; GOLDMAN E, 2013, REV FINANC, V17, P1617, DOI 10.1093/ROF/RFS039; HUNG MY, 2015, CONTEMP ACCOUNT RES, V32, P1641, DOI 10.1111/1911-3846.12134; JOHNSON S, 2003, J FINANC ECON, V67, P351, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(02)00255-6; KE B., 2016, WORKING PAPER; LAMBERT-MOGILIANSKY A., 2002, EUROPEAN J POLITICAL, V18, P47, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0176-2680(01)00068-4; LI K, 2009, J COMP ECON, V37, P471, DOI 10.1016/J.JCE.2009.07.001; LIU JL, 2012, J INT FINANC MARK I, V22, P814, DOI 10.1016/J.INTFIN.2012.05.005; LIU Q.

VIETNAM IS KNOWN AS AN EMERGING MARKET, WHICH DEPENDS DIRECTLY ON AGRICULTURE-RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD, IN WHICH THE ISSUE OF RURAL CREDIT ACCESS STILL REMAINS A CONFOUNDING PROBLEM. THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF RURAL CREDIT MARKETS, THE DETERMINANTS OF FARMER ACCESS TO THE MARKETS, THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CREDIT ACCESS IN VIETNAM AND BRIEFLY COMPARING WITH THOSE OF SOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS QUESTION IS ADDRESSED BY REVIEWING EXISTING LITERATURE AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, FOLLOWED BY A COMPREHENSIVE CASE STUDY IN VIETNAM. COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW WITH SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS ARE METHODS THAT ARE APPLIED IN THIS RESEARCH. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS INDICATE THE FEATURES OF VIETNAM MARKETS AS PARTICIPATED CONSTRAINTS, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, AND SEGMENTATION. OTHER RESULTS REVEAL THE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT ACCESSIBILITY. IMPACTS OF CREDIT ACCESS ON OUTPUT PRODUCTION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, AND POVERTY REDUCTION ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS PAPER. SOME MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR HOUSEHOLDS THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LENDING NETWORKS; FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RELATING TO EXPAND TARGET CLIENTS AS WELL AS CAPITAL ALLOCATION; AND, FOR POLICY-MAKERS VIA ENSURING MARKET COMPETITIVENESS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE LONG RUN.","[TA NHAT LINH; LE VAN CHI; LE THANH TAM] NATL ECON UNIV, SCH BANKING & FINANCE, HANOI 100000, VIETNAM.; [TA NHAT LINH; LEBAILLY, PHILIPPE] UNIV LIEGE, GEMBLOUX AGROBIO TECH, ECON & RURAL DEV, B-5030 GEMBLOUX, BELGIUM.; [HOANG THANH LONG] HUE UNIV, UNIV ECON, FAC ECON INFORMAT SYST, HUE 530000, VIETNAM.","LINH, TN (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL ECON UNIV, SCH BANKING & FINANCE, HANOI 100000, VIETNAM.; LINH, TN (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LIEGE, GEMBLOUX AGROBIO TECH, ECON & RURAL DEV, B-5030 GEMBLOUX, BELGIUM.","TANHATLINH@GMAIL.COM; HOANGTHANHLONG@HCE.EDU.VN; VANCHI.LE88@GMAIL.COM; TAMINHANOI@GMAIL.COM; PHILIPPE.LEBAILLY@ULIEGE.BE","NATIONAL ECONOMICS UNIVERSITY, HANOI, VIETNAM","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY NATIONAL ECONOMICS UNIVERSITY, HANOI, VIETNAM.","ADGER WN, 1999, WORLD DEV, V27, P249, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00136-3; AHMAD N., 2011, PAK DEV REV, V42, P469; ALEEM I, 1990, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V4, P329, DOI 10.1093/WBER/4.3.329; AMIN S, 2003, J DEV ECON, V70, P59, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00087-1; ATIENO R., 2001, FORMAL INFORMAL I LE; BARSLUND M, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P485, DOI 10.1080/00220380801980798; BASHIR M.

WE DOCUMENT THAT FIRMS WHOSE MANAGERS HAVE PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS RECEIVE MORE TRADE CREDIT, ESPECIALLY IN FIRMS THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE STATE (NON-SOES), WHICH HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO FORMAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES. THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, LOW SOCIAL TRUST AND HIGH PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION, ALSO STRENGTHEN THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MANAGERS' PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS AND FIRMS' ACCESS TO TRADE CREDIT. WE FURTHER PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT DIRECTORS' PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS ALSO BRING FIRMS MORE TRADE CREDIT AND THAT FIRMS WITH PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS MAKE MORE USE OF FINANCING COMPONENT OF TRADE CREDIT AND ABNORMAL TRADE CREDIT. OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO A SERIES OF ROBUSTNESS AND ENDOGENEITY TESTS. OVERALL, WE ARGUE THAT MANAGERIAL PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS, OTHER THAN POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, HELP FIRMS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO FORMAL FINANCING, TO OBTAIN INFORMAL FINANCING RESOURCES.

THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION THAT BECAUSE NON-STATE-OWNED FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER BANK DISCRIMINATION FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY TEND TO ADDRESS THEIR FINANCING DISADVANTAGES BY BUILDING ECONOMIC BONDS WITH BANKS. WE ALSO FIND THAT AMONG NON-STATE-OWNED FIRMS, THOSE THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT BANK OWNERSHIP HAVE LOWER INTEREST EXPENSES, AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO INCREASE CASH HOLDINGS BUT MORE LIKELY TO OBTAIN SHORT-TERM LOANS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICY IS TIGHT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE FIRMS BUILDING ECONOMIC BONDS WITH BANKS CAN ENJOY BENEFITS SUCH AS LOWER FINANCIAL EXPENSES AND BETTER LENDING TERMS DURING DIFFICULT TIMES.

HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE MAINLY ASSUMED THAT CREDIT HAS A HOMOGENEOUS IMPACT ON RECIPIENTS. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY FURTHER EXAMINING THE IMPACTS OF CREDIT ON DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ACCESSED HOUSEHOLDS CATEGORIZED BY RELATIVE POVERTY, LOAN VOLUMES, ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICES AND ETHNICITY IN VIETNAM. THIS PAPER USES DATA OF 1338 HOUSEHOLDS COLLECTED FROM THE VIETNAM ACCESS RESOURCES HOUSEHOLD SURVEY IN 2012. TO INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF ESTIMATION MEASURES, THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE IMPACT ESTIMATOR IS FURTHER CONSTRUCTED BY APPLYING THE BOOTSTRAPPING APPROACH TO THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING. RESULTS SHOW THAT CREDIT ACCESS AFFECTS RECIPIENT GROUPS HETEROGENEOUSLY. ALTHOUGH THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE IMPACTS ON NON-FARM INCOME, CREDIT HAS NO EFFECT ON FARM INCOME, EVEN FOR RECIPIENTS WITH MORE ANNUAL VISITS TO AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION. WHILE CREDIT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES TOTAL INCOME, PER CAPITA INCOME, AND NONFARM INCOME OF THE KINH MAJORITY, IT HAS LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ON THOSE INCOME COMPONENTS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES. CREDIT TENDS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE IMPACTS ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF THE BETTER-OFF, THE RICHEST AND THOSE RECEIVING LARGER CREDIT VOLUMES. RESULTS IMPLY THAT HOUSEHOLDS WITH FAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TEND TO BENEFIT FROM ACCESSING RURAL CREDIT. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.

ONE COMPONENT OF THE COUNTERARGUMENT HOLDS THAT RELATIONSHIP-BASED LENDING HAS SERVED AS AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CHALLENGE THIS ASSERTION WITH EMPIRICAL FINDINGS THAT SHOW BANK CREDIT ALLOCATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ""CONNECTIONS"" UNDERMINES THE IMPACT OF FINANCE ON INVESTMENT GROWTH. OUR DATA COME FROM VIETNAM, WHERE-LIKE CHINA-THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ARE EXPANDING DRAMATICALLY BUT RULE OF LAW HAS NOT KEPT PACE. ALTHOUGH VIETNAM'S BANKING SECTOR IS IN TRANSITION TOWARD A HEALTHIER SYSTEM, IT STILL ALLOCATES A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CREDIT TO ""CONNECTED"" ENTERPRISES IN LESS COMPETITIVE REGIONS. WE FIND THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE AN INEFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CHANNELING BANK CREDIT TO THE MOST PROFITABLE INVESTORS. USING A TWO-STAGE EMPIRICAL APPROACH, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT BANKS PLACE GREATER VALUE ON CONNECTIONS THAN PERFORMANCE AND THAT THE FIRMS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO BANK LOANS ARE NO MORE PROFITABLE THAN FIRMS WITHOUT THEM. BY SOME MEASURES, CONNECTED FIRMS ARE EVEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABLE. WE CONCLUDE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT THE MOST PROFITABLE INVESTORS IN VIETNAM HAVE FORGONE THE FORMAL BANKING SYSTEM, PREFERRING TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES OUT OF REINVESTED EARNINGS OR INFORMAL LOANS (JEL G21, G28, G30, O12, K11).","[MALESKY, EDMUND J.] UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, GRAD SCH INT RELAT & PACIFIC STUDIES, SAN DIEGO, CA 92103 USA.; [TAUSSIG, MARKUS] HARVARD UNIV, SCH BUSINESS, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.","MALESKY, EJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, GRAD SCH INT RELAT & PACIFIC STUDIES, SAN DIEGO, CA 92103 USA.","EMALESKY@UCSD.EDU; MTAUSSIG@HBS.HARVARD.EDU",NA,NA,"ACEMOGLU D, 2005, J POLIT ECON, V113, P949, DOI 10.1086/432166; ADAMS DW, 1984, UNDERMINING RURAL DE; AKERLOF GA, 1970, Q J ECON, V84, P488, DOI 10.2307/1879431; ALLEN F, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V77, P57, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.06.010; ALLEN FR, 2007, W FIN ASS ANN M; ANH M, 2005, VIETNAM BUSINES 0621; BANERJEE A, 2004, REV ECON STUD, V71, P19, DOI 10.1111/0034-6527.00274; BECK T, 2003, HDB NEW I EC, P251; BECK T, 2005, FINANCE FIRM S UNPUB; BECK T, 2004, 2997 WORLD BANK; BECK T, 2004, FINANCING PATT UNPUB; BERGER AN, 1999, J BANK FINANC, V23, P135, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00125-3; BERGER AN, 1995, J BUS, V68, P351, DOI 10.1086/296668; BERGER AN, 1998, J BANK FINANC, V22, P613, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7; BERGER AN, 2001, J BANK FINANC, V25, P2127, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(01)00189-3; BERGER AN, 2002, ECON J, V112, P32, DOI DOI 10.1111/1468-0297.00682; CARLIER A, 2003, INFORMALITY PLAYING; CARLIER A, 2005, VIETNAM PRIVATE SECT; CULL R, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V77, P117, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.05.010; CULL R, 2004, WORLD BANK C SMALL M; DE SOTO H., 2000, MYSTERY CAPITAL; DIAMOND DW, 1991, Q J ECON, V106, P709, DOI 10.2307/2937924; DIAMOND DW, 1991, J POLIT ECON, V99, P689, DOI 10.1086/261775; DO T, 2003, 3120 WORLD BANK; DUFHUES T., 2003, J I INNOVATION DEV T, V7, P29; FAN J, 2005, POLITICALLY CONNECTE; FISMAN R, 2001, AM ECON REV, V91, P1095, DOI 10.1257/AER.91.4.1095; FISMAN R, 2003, [NO TITLE CAPTURED], V3, P1; FRANKS J, 2003, 1003FE01 OXF FIN RES; GAINSBOROUGH M, 2004, HANOI LOCAL GOVT VIE, P259; GERSCHENKRON ALEXANDER, 1962, EC BACKWARDNESS HIST; GIANNETTI MA, 2005, 498 ECB; GREIF A, 1993, AM ECON REV, V83, P525; GREIF A, 1989, J ECON HIST, V61, P1; *GSO, 2006, STAT YB GSO; *GSO, 2005, REAL SIT ENT RES SUR; GUISO L, 2000, 7563 NAT BUR EC RES; HEMLIN M, 1998, WORKING PAPER SERIES, V236; HUANG Y, 2006, CATO J, V26, P287; IMF, 2005, 05148 IMF; JAFFEE DM, 1976, Q J ECON, V90, P651, DOI 10.2307/1885327; JAYARATNE J, 1996, Q J ECON, V111, P639, DOI 10.2307/2946668; JOHNSON S, 2002, J LAW ECON ORGAN, V18, P221, DOI 10.1093/JLEO/18.1.221; KING RG, 1993, Q J ECON, V108, P717, DOI 10.2307/2118406; KING RG, 1993, J MONETARY ECON, V32, P513, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(93)90028-E; KOKKO A, 2004, EUROPEAN I JAPANESE, V193; LA PORTA R, 1998, J POLIT ECON, V106, P1113, DOI 10.1086/250042; LA PORTA R, 2003, Q J ECON, V118, P231, DOI 10.1162/00335530360535199; LAEVEN L, 2001, J COMP ECON, V29, P207, DOI 10.1006/JCEC.2001.1708; LAPORTA R, 1997, J FINANC, V52, P1131, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.1997.TB02727.X; LAPORTA R, 2000, NATL BUREAU EC RES W, V7620; LE N.

THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WORK IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR OR ON SMALL PIECES OF LAND AND ARE ENGAGED IN CARE WORK WITH LITTLE OR NO PAY. ALSO, WOMEN HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO CREDIT, LAND, AGRICULTURAL INPUTS, EQUIPMENT AND EXTENSION SERVICES, AS WELL AS MARKETS FOR THEIR PRODUCE THAN MEN. SOME OF THE INEQUITIES ARE EMBEDDED IN THE DEEP-ROOTED CULTURAL NORMS AND BELIEFS IN THE AFRICAN SOCIETIES. TO SOME EXTENT, THE INEQUALITIES CAN PARTLY BE ADDRESSED BY CHANGING OF POLICIES THAT REINFORCE GENDER INEQUALITIES AS WELL AS FORMULATING AND ENFORCING LAWS THAT PROMOTE WOMENS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT. THUS, MORE COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH WORK IS STILL REQUIRED TO HIGHLIGHT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH GENDER INEQUALITY AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MOVE TOWARDS REDUCING GENDER INEQUALITY. THE FOUR PAPERS IN THIS JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT EXPLORE THE ISSUE OF GENDER INEQUALITY AND LOOK AT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENDER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE FIRST PAPER BY SEGUINO AND WERE IS ON GENDER, DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT A SHIFT IN EMPHASIS OF CENTRAL BANK TARGETS TO EMPLOYMENT AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT CAN HELP REDUCE GENDER GAP. THE SECOND PAPER BY CHERYL DOSS FOCUSES ON COLLECTING GENDER DISAGGREGATED DATA TO IMPROVE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. ITS MAIN FINDING IS THAT CONSISTENT MEASURES OF GENDER ASSET AND WEALTH GAPS PROVIDE A MEANS OF TRACKING IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF POLICIES DESIGNED TO REDUCE POVERTY AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE THIRD PAPER IS ON GENDER AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT IN AFRICA: EVIDENCE AND POLICY BY NAOMI NETSAYI WEKWETE. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT INITIATIVES THAT IMPROVE WOMENS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT SUCH AS SKILLS TRAINING AMONG OTHERS PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. FINALLY, THE FOURTH PAPER BY NANCY FOLBRE IS ON THE CARE ECONOMY IN AFRICA: SUBSISTENCE PRODUCTION AND UNPAID CARE. THE MAIN FINDING OF THE PAPER IS THAT ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT REDUCE THE CARE BURDEN ON WOMEN WITH INVESTMENTS THAT ENHANCE REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF UNPAID WORK AND POOL THE RISKS OF CARING FOR DEPENDENTS THROUGH SOCIAL INSURANCE WHICH PROMOTES ECONOMIC GROWTH BY IMPROVING THE CAPABILITIES OF BOTH WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO FREE UP LABOUR TIME FOR MORE REMUNERATIVE ACTIVITIES.","[MANDA, DAMIANO K.; MWAKUBO, SAMUEL] AFRICAN ECON RES CONSORTIUM, NAIROBI, KENYA.","MANDA, DK (REPRINT AUTHOR), 3RD FLOOR MIDDLE EAST BANK TOWERS BLDG,MILIMAN RD, NAIROBI, KENYA.","DAMIANO.MANDA@AERCAFRICA.ORG",NA,NA,"AFRICAN PARTNERSHIP FORUM (APF), 2007, 8 M AFR PARTN FOR BE; BERIK G, 2009, FEM ECON, V15, P1, DOI 10.1080/13545700903093524; BRAUNSTEIN E, 2011, FEM ECON, V17, P5, DOI 10.1080/13545701.2011.602354; BUDLENDER D., 2002, GENDER BUDGETS MAKE; DEERE CD, 2012, DEV CHANGE, V43, P505, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7660.2012.01764.X; DEERE CD, 2006, FEM ECON, V12, P1, DOI 10.1080/13545700500508056; DUTT A.

HOWEVER, AGRICULTURE FORMS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE LIVES OF THE RURAL HOUSEHOLDS, WHO CONSTITUTE ABOUT 85 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION. THIS STUDY USES THE UGANDA HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS CONDUCTED IN 1992/93 AND 1999/2000 TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON ACCESS TO, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DEMAND FOR CREDIT AMONG THE RURAL POPULATION. WE EMPLOY THE PROBIT, TOBIT AND MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL ESTIMATIONS AND WE ANALYSE DEMAND FOR CREDIT AND FIND THAT UGANDA'S CREDIT MARKET IS HIGHLY SEGMENTED. THE RURAL PEASANT PRODUCERS ARE LARGELY SERVED BY RELATIVES/FRIENDS AND SELF-HELP CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS AND THEIR LOAN APPLICATIONS ARE LESS LIKELY TO SUCCEED, AND OF THOSE THAT DO, SMALLER LOANS ARE GRANTED. THE EDUCATED AND THE YOUNG ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEMAND CREDIT WHILE WOMEN ARE LESS LIKELY TO, AND TO APPLY FOR SMALLER LOANS. THEREFORE, WHILE GOVERNMENT'S AGRICULTURAL MODERNIZATION POLICY CONSIDERS CREDIT AS AN IMPORTANT INPUT TO ITS SUCCESS AND AS THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO ROLL OUT THE 'WEALTH-FOR-ALL' PROGRAMME, MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GET CREDIT TO THE SECTOR AND TO ENSURE THAT IT CAN BE USEFULLY UTILIZED.

THE LACK OF ACCESS TO FINANCES IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT GROWTH CONSTRAINTS THE SMES FACE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE FIRM AND COUNTRY SPECIFIC DETERMINANTS OF THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT LEVELS OF SMES IN SELECTED EMERGING WESTERN BALKAN ECONOMIES. THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF THE FINANCING OBSTACLES EXAMINED IN THE SAMPLED COUNTRIES WERE: FIRM SIZE, OWNERSHIP TYPE, AND AGE, ACCOUNTING INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY, THE DEPTH OF CREDIT INFORMATION INDEXES, THE BANKING SECTOR CONCENTRATION, PROPERTY REGISTRATION COSTS; AND PER CAPITA GDP. THE FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT FIRM SIZE IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT LEVELS OF SMES IN THE SELECTED ECONOMIES. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT OLDER FIRMS ARE FINANCIALLY MORE CONSTRAINED IN THE REGION. THE POSSIBLE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FIRM AGE AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT ARE DISCUSSED. BANKING SECTOR CONCENTRATION LEVEL PLAYS CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE EXTERNAL FINANCING OF SMES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. BY CLOSELY EXAMINING THE FIRM CHARACTERISTICS AND COUNTRY-LEVEL FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF THE FINANCING OBSTACLES FACED BY SMES, WE OBSERVED THAT IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES OVERALL INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN FIRM-SPECIFIC DETERMINANTS.","[NIZAEVA, MIRGUL] ALA TOO INT UNIV, BISHKEK, KYRGYZSTAN.; [COSKUN, ALI] AMER UNIV MIDDLE EAST, AL UQIYLAH, KUWAIT.","NIZAEVA, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), ALA TOO INT UNIV, BISHKEK, KYRGYZSTAN.","MIRGULNIZAEVA@GMAIL.COM; ALI.COSKUN@AUM.EDU.KW",NA,NA,"AFANDI E, 2014, ASIAN EC FINANCIAL R, V4, P1158; AMIN M, 2012, EMPIR ECON, V42, P1035, DOI 10.1007/S00181-011-0479-7; ASIKHIA O.

THE STUDY USES NIGERIAN ENTERPRISE SURVEYS DATA FOR 2010 TO CONSTRUCT A DIRECT MEASURE OF CREDIT CONSTRAINT. FROM PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATIONS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT MATTERS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. FIRMS THAT ARE CREDIT CONSTRAINED HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OUTPUT PER WORKER, CAPITAL PER WORKER, EMPLOYMENT OF LABOUR AND INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS FOR EXPANSION COMPARED TO FIRMS THAT ARE NOT CREDIT CONSTRAINED. THIS IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR WOMEN-OWNED ENTERPRISES AFTER ADJUSTING FOR BIAS IN THE ESTIMATIONS AND CONTROLLING FOR SAMPLING WEIGHTS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ONE WAY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA IS TO MAKE ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT LESS STRINGENT.

OUR THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY'S ROLE IN PROVIDING INFORMATION, THUS LOWERING THE SEARCH COSTS OF THE BORROWER AND MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT COSTS FOR THE LENDER. FROM OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS, COMMUNITY AND FAMILY NETWORKS ARE IMPORTANT IN KNOWING A PLACE TO BORROW, AS WELL AS FOR LOAN APPROVAL. CONSISTENT WITH AN INFORMATION-BASED EXPLANATION OF NETWORKS, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY NETWORKS HAVE A LARGER IMPACT ON CREDIT AWARENESS OF NEW CREDIT INSTITUTIONS WITH A LOWER IMPACT ON AWARENESS OF ESTABLISHED CREDIT SOURCES. INTERESTINGLY, WE FIND THAT WOMEN BENEFIT FROM PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY NETWORKS MORE THAN MEN. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE RICH BENEFIT FROM COMMUNITY NETWORKS MORE THAN THE POOR.

THE STATISTICAL MODELS SHOWED THAT THE INTEREST RATE,FARM EXPENDITURE, THE AMOUNT BORROWED FROM ALTERNATIVE SOURCES, FARM SIZE AND SAVINGS WERE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT DEMAND, WHILE INTEREST RATES CHARGED, THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS OF RESPONDENTS, THE AMOUNT OF LOAN DEMANDED AND THE PROPORTION OF PREVIOUS LOANS REPAID WERE THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT SUPPLY.

THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES FIRM ACCESS TO CREDIT IN THE REGION, FOCUSING ON THE ROLE OF THE CREDIT MARKET STRUCTURE. THROUGH AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION BASED ON THE WORLD BANK ENTERPRISE SURVEY, WE FIND THAT ACCESS TO BANK CREDIT IS VERY HETEROGENEOUS. ON AVERAGE, SMALLER AND LESS PRODUCTIVE FIRMS ARE LESS LIKELY TO APPLY FOR CREDIT AND MORE LIKELY TO BE FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED. BESIDES, A HIGH DEGREE OF BANK PENETRATION AND COMPETITION IS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH A LOWER PROBABILITY THAT BORROWERS ARE FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED. FINALLY, FOREIGN BANKS PENETRATION HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ACCESS TO CREDIT PARTICULARLY IN LESS DEVELOPED AND MORE CONCENTRATED MARKETS, WHILE IT HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN MORE COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIALLY DEVELOPED MARKETS.","[PRESBITERO, ANDREA F.] INT MONETARY FUND, WASHINGTON, DC 20431 USA.; [PRESBITERO, ANDREA F.] MONEY & FINANCE RES GRP MOFIR, ANCONA, ITALY.; [RABELLOTTI, ROBERTA] UNIV PAVIA, DEPT POLIT & SOCIAL SCI, I-27100 PAVIA, ITALY.","PRESBITERO, AF (REPRINT AUTHOR), INT MONETARY FUND, WASHINGTON, DC 20431 USA.; PRESBITERO, AF (REPRINT AUTHOR), MONEY & FINANCE RES GRP MOFIR, ANCONA, ITALY.","APRESBITERO@IMF.ORG; ROBERTA.RABELLOTTI@UNIPV.IT",NA,NA,"BANERJEE A., 2012, REV ECON STUD, V81, P572; BECK T, 2004, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V36, P627, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2004.0039; BECK T, 2006, J INT MONEY FINANC, V25, P932, DOI 10.1016/J.JIMONFIN.2006.07.005; BECK T, 2011, J FINANC SERV RES, V39, P35, DOI 10.1007/S10693-010-0085-4; BERGER AN, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V76, P237, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.06.003; BROWN M, 2011, ECON POLICY, P93, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-0327.2010.00259.X; BRUHN M, 2013, 6442 WORLD BANK; BRUHN M, 2014, WORLD BANK RES OBSER, V29, P186, DOI 10.1093/WBRO/LKU002; CARDIM DE CARVALHO F.

THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY ANALYSES FIRMS NOT ONLY FROM THE SMES POINT OF VIEW, BUT ALSO SHOWS RESULTS FOR MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES SEPARATELY. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ANALYSED THE DETERMINANTS OF ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES AT EACH COUNTRY LEVEL FOR AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF COUNTRY-LEVEL VARIATIONS IN SME FINANCING. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MICRO FIRMS AND FIRMS OWNED AND OPERATED BY WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF CREDITS FROM BANKS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FOUND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PLEDGE OF COLLATERAL AND ACCESS TO FINANCE. WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIUM FIRMS, WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT INNOVATIVE FIRMS HAVE A LARGER AMOUNT OF CREDIT FROM BANKS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE LOAN SIZE INCREASES AS THE INTEREST RATES INCREASE IN PARTICULAR FOR SMES ON THE WHOLE AND FOR MICRO-FIRMS, ALTHOUGH THE INTEREST RATE IS IN A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOAN SIZE IN CZECH REPUBLIC.","[RAHMAN, ASHIQUR; BELAS, JAROSLAV] TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN, DEPT ENTERPRISE ECON, MOSTNI 5139, ZLIN 76001, CZECH REPUBLIC.; [RAHMAN, M.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY EMPLOYED A PROBIT MODEL WITH MARGINAL EFFECTS AND A GENERALIZED BLINDER-OAXACA DECOMPOSITION ESTIMATION ON A RANDOMLY SELECTED DATA OF 1,239 ENTREPRENEURS FROM EIGHT COMMERCIAL BANKS' CREDIT RECORDS ABOUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL, FIRM AND LOAN CHARACTERISTICS. FINDINGS - THE STUDY REVEALED THAT CREDIT RATIONING PERSISTS AND THAT APPLYING FOR A RELATIVELY LONGER PAYMENT PERIOD, PROVIDING COLLATERAL AND GUARANTOR, BEING ILLITERATE, BEING RELATIVELY OLDER AND BEING IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CREDIT RATIONED, WHILE HAVING SOME RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK, HAVING NON-MANDATORY SAVINGS AND APPLYING FROM A BANK WITH RELATIVELY HIGH INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CREDIT RATIONED. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED A CREDIT GAP OF 17.77 PERCENT AND A POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BORROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AS THE GAP WAS LARGELY BEING INFLUENCED BY UNEXPLAINED FACTORS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE RESEARCH WAS INTENDED TO COVER A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN GHANA. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE BANKS WERE UNWILLING TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BORROWERS; HENCE, THE RESEARCH WAS LIMITED TO ONLY EIGHT COMMERCIAL BANKS WHO PROVIDED THE AUTHOR WITH THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE STUDY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT POLICIES THAT ENHANCE HUMAN CAPITAL, WOMEN, AND OLDER ACCESS TO CREDIT AND AGRICULTURAL-ORIENTED FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHERS, WILL GO A LONG WAY TO REDUCE RATIONING AND INCREASE ACCESS TO CREDIT, ESPECIALLY TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESEARCH PROPOSES THE USE OF GROUP LENDING AS A FORM OF COLLATERAL AND MONITORING TO EASE RISKS AND DEFAULT, AND HENCE SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO INCREASE ACCESS AND OUTREACH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER LOOKS AT THE COMPREHENSIVE WAY ABOUT THE VARIOUS FACTORS DETERMINING CREDIT RATIONING IN THAT IT CONSIDERS NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL, ECONOMIC/FIRM AND LOAN CHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISCRIMINATION TOWARD THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR EXISTS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANKS CREDIT MARKET.","[SACKEY, FRANK GYIMAH] CATHOLIC UNIV COLL GHANA, DEPT ECON, SUNYANI, GHANA.","SACKEY, FG (REPRINT AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV COLL GHANA, DEPT ECON, SUNYANI, GHANA.","FRANKSACKEY@YAHOO.COM",NA,NA,"ABARU BM, 2006, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V66, P215, DOI 10.1108/00214660680001188; ACQUAH P.

IT INTENDS TO SHOW THE INFLUENCE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS' CHARACTERISTICS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION, USING THE WORLD BANK GLOBAL FINDEX DATABASE 2014 FOR 16 COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH-A PROBIT MODEL IS USED TO EXAMINE THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE MENAP REGION. THESE CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDE GENDER, AGE, INCOME AND EDUCATION. INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE LINKED TO THE MAIN FINANCIAL-INCLUSION INDICATORS INCLUDE HAVING A FORMAL ACCOUNT AND FORMAL SAVING AND BORROWING. THE BARRIERS TO HAVING A FORMAL ACCOUNT, ALTERNATIVE BORROWING SOURCES ANDMOTIVATIONS FOR BORROWING ARE ALSO LINKED TO THE RESPONDENTS' CHARACTERISTICS. FINDINGS-THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT FEMALES AND THE POOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, WHILE EDUCATION LEVEL ENHANCES FINANCIAL INCLUSION. AS DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE CONSIDER ACCESS TO CREDIT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVING THEIR LIVES, THE STUDY FINDS THAT THE POOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BORROW FOR MEDICAL ISSUES THAN FOR OTHER NEEDS. WHILE ISLAM IS THE MAJORITY RELIGION IN THE MENAP REGION, IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A BARRIER TO HAVING A FORMAL BANK ACCOUNT. FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT INCOME QUINTILES ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE INFORMAL FINANCIAL SOURCES, WHILE THE EDUCATED ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE FORMAL ONES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS-THE RESULTS SHOW THAT POLICYMAKERS IN MENAP SHOULD MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AS A WAY TO ENHANCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION. ALSO, GOVERNMENTS INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTRAL BANKS, FINANCIAL MINISTRIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, COULD BUILD ON THESE RESULTS TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AS A WAY TOWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE MENAP REGION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE-TO THE AUTHOR'S BEST KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUALS' CHARACTERISTICS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN THE MENAP REGION.","[SHIHADEH, FADI HASSAN] PALESTINE TECH UNIV, TULKARM, PALESTINE.","SHIHADEH, FH (REPRINT AUTHOR), PALESTINE TECH UNIV, TULKARM, PALESTINE.","FADIH20@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"AKUDUGU M.A., 2013, RES J FINANCE ACCOUN, V4, P1; ALLEN F, 2016, J FINANC INTERMED, V27, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JFI.2015.12.003; ANSON JOSE, 2013, 6630 WORLD BANK; ARDIC O.P., 2011, 5537 WORLD BANK; BAUM C.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH COLLATERAL OWNERSHIP IS NOT AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF PARTICIPATION, RELATIVELY WEALTHIER FAMILIES GAIN ACCESS TO MICROCREDIT. THE IMPACT OF MICROCREDIT ON VARIOUS HOUSEHOLD OUTCOMES IS GENERALLY STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT, EXCEPT FOR SALES OF NONFARM ENTERPRISES FOR THE NONPOOR AND SCHOOLING EXPENDITURES FOR THE POOR.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - USING THE DIRECT ELICITATION METHOD (DEM), THE AUTHORS CONSIDER BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CREDIT RATIONING. FINDINGS - EMPIRICAL EVIDENCES CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSEHOLD HEAD'S AGE, GENDER AND EDUCATION TO HOUSEHOLD'S LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CREDIT CONSTRAINED. IN ADDITION, HOUSEHOLDS WHO HAVE ADVANTAGES IN FARM LAND SIZE, LABOUR RESOURCES AND NON-FARM INCOME ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CREDIT CONSTRAINED. POOR HOUSEHOLDS ARE OBSERVED TO REMAIN RESTRICTED BY FORMAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS. RESULTS FROM THE ENDOGENOUS SWITCHING REGRESSION MODEL SUGGEST THAT CREDIT CONSTRAINTS NEGATIVELY IMPACT HOUSEHOLD'S CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA AND INFORMAL CREDIT CAN ACT AS A SUBSTITUTE TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF FORMAL CREDIT CONSTRAINTS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - ONE LIMITATION ARISES FROM THE USAGE OF THE DEM TO IDENTIFY CREDIT CONSTRAINED HOUSEHOLDS. THE METHOD CANNOT DETECT EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE CONSTRAINTS. ANOTHER LIMITATION IS THE INABILITY OF CROSS-SECTION DATA TO CAPTURE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSEHOLD WELFARE. FINALLY, CAUSES OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS FROM THE LENDER'S VIEW CANNOT BE OBSERVED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ENHANCE THE CREDIT ALLOCATION REGIME TO REDUCE THE TRANSACTION COST AND PROVIDE TARGET HOUSEHOLDS WITH SUFFICIENT CREDIT. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT HIGH TRANSACTION COST AND THE MISMATCH BETWEEN CREDIT DEMAND AND SUPPLY STEMMING FROM INFORMATION ASYMMETRY. THE GOVERNMENT CAN HELP FORMAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REDUCE INFORMATION COST BY ENCOURAGING THE ACTIVE ROLE OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS WOMEN UNIONS, YOUTH UNIONS AND VETERAN UNIONS IN BRIDGING RURAL FARM HOUSEHOLDS WITH FORMAL LENDERS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES FOCUSING ON DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON RURAL FARM HOUSEHOLDS. TO THE BEST OF THE KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO STUDY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ON RURAL FARM HOUSEHOLD WELFARE PARTICULARLY IN VIETNAM. IN ADDITION, THE STUDIES RELATED TO CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ONLY CONSIDERED FULL QUANTITY RATIONING (HOUSEHOLDS APPLIED FOR THE LOAN BUT WERE REJECTED), OMITTING THE CASE OF PARTLY QUANTITY RATIONING (LOAN OBTAINED BY THE BORROWERS IS LESS THAN THEIR DEMAND) AND SELF-RATIONING.","[MINH CHAU TRAN; GAN, CHRISTOPHER; HU, BAIDING] LINCOLN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING FINANCE & ECON, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND.","GAN, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), LINCOLN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING FINANCE & ECON, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND.","CHRISTOPHER.GAN@LINCOLN.AC.NZ",NA,NA,"ALI DA, 2014, J AFR ECON, V23, P493, DOI 10.1093/JAE/EJU008; ALI DA, 2014, J DEV STUD, V50, P649, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2014.887687; BAIYEGUNHI LJS, 2010, AFR J AGR RES, V5, P2243; BARSLUND M, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P485, DOI 10.1080/00220380801980798; BOSE P, 1998, J DEV ECON, V56, P265, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(98)00066-2; BOUCHER SR, 2009, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V57, P609, DOI 10.1086/598763; BRAVERMAN A, 1986, WORLD DEV, V14, P1253, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(86)90104-X; BURGESS R, 2005, AM ECON REV, V95, P780, DOI 10.1257/0002828054201242; CAMPBELL J, 1989, REV ECON STUD, V56, P357, DOI 10.2307/2297552; CHAUDHURI K, 2012, APPL ECON, V44, P803, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2010.524627; COUDOUEL A, 2002, POVERTY MEASUREMENT; CUONG NV, 2008, DEV ECON, V46, P151, DOI 10.1111/J.1746-1049.2008.00061.X; NGUYEN CV, 2014, DEV ECON, V52, P154, DOI 10.1111/DEVE.12042; DE BRAUW A, 2007, AM J AGR ECON, V89, P430, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8276.2006.00989.X; DONG F., 2010, EFFECTS CREDIT CONST; DUFHUES T., 2005, 01 RES AGR APPL EC; DUONG PB, 2002, WORLD DEV, V30, P319; FEDER G, 1990, AM J AGR ECON, V72, P1151, DOI 10.2307/1242524; FENWICK L.

THE STUDY USED SECONDARY DATA FROM THE VIETNAM ACCESS TO RESOURCES HOUSEHOLD SURVEY (VARHS) PUBLISHED IN 2013-14, AND ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN BY ECONOMETRIC APPROACHES SUCH AS LOGISTIC AND MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS AND PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING METHODS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AMONG THOSE PARTICIPANTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED CREDIT, APPROXIMATELY 85 PER CENT OF WOMEN OBTAINED LESS CREDIT THAN MEN; AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT WOMEN OBTAINED WAS ALSO LESS (ON AVERAGE, APPROXIMATELY 1.8 PER CENT LESS). GENDER, NUMBER OF YEARS OF SCHOOLING, MARITAL STATUS, PARTICIPATION IN AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES, OFF-FARM EMPLOYMENT, AND OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR A MALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLD POSITIVELY INFLUENCED DISCRIMINATION IN OBTAINING CREDIT AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT OBTAINED. MOREOVER, THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING RESULTS FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE INCREASE IN THE CREDIT OBTAINED BY MALES WAS 220,000 VIETNAMESE DONG (VND) AND THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOUR OF MEN.

FINDINGS THE STUDY REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: WOMEN EXPRESSED HAVING MORE BARRIERS TO OBTAINING A BUSINESS LOAN THAN MEN; GENDER HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON WOMEN' CREDIT DEFAULT; AND WOMEN WERE LESS LIKELY TO DEFAULT A LOAN THAN MALE LOAN BORROWERS DID. AN EXPLORATION OF THE REASONS FOR CREDIT ACCESS AND DEFAULT FOUND THAT FEMALE LOAN APPLICANTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO DISPLAY A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND CONFIDENCE IN LOAN APPLICATION.

IN 2004, THE KMT WAS EXPECTED TO WIN, BUT EVENTUALLY LOST TO THE DPP. WE USE THESE TWO EXOGENOUS EVENTS TO INVESTIGATE THREE ISSUES: HOW POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ARE RELATED TO PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS, HOW THE ENTRENCHED POSITION OF THE RULING PARTY AFFECTS THE TYPES OF PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS AND HOW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS RELATED TO PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS. WE FIND THAT KMT-CONNECTED (DPP-CONNECTED) FIRMS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER (LOWER) ABNORMAL RETURNS BEFORE THE 2004 ELECTION. THIS PATTERN OF RETURNS WAS REVERSED AFTER THE UNEXPECTED RESULT. MOREOVER, WE FIND THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS. HOWEVER, THE TYPES OF PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS DIFFERED BETWEEN KMT-CONNECTED AND DPP-CONNECTED FIRMS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE ENTRENCHED POWER OF THE RULING PARTY. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS, PROBABLY BECAUSE FIRMS WITH GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HAVE MORE ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SOURCES.

RELYING ON A LARGE SAMPLE OF NOTARISED LOANS, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE CREDIT MARKET AS LENDERS AND BORROWERS. HOWEVER, THEIR PARTICIPATION WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF MEN. IN ADDITION, WOMEN RECEIVED SMALLER LOANS AND PAID HIGHER INTEREST RATES THAN MEN. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LOWER PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN AS BORROWERS AND THEIR SMALLER LOANS WERE LARGELY A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL. IN ADDITION, MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE IN INTEREST RATES RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENCES IN LOAN SIZES. AS WOMEN RECEIVED SMALLER LOANS AND THERE WERE PROBABLY FIXED COSTS INVOLVED IN GRANTING A LOAN, MAKING A LOAN TO A WOMAN IMPLIED A HIGHER AVERAGE COST. RESUMEN ESTE ARTICULO ANALIZA EL PAPEL DE LAS MUJERES Y LA DISCRIMINACION POR GENERO EN EL MERCADO DE CREDITO HIPOTECARIO EN PERU ENTRE 1860 Y 1875. BASANDONOS EN UNA MUESTRA SIGNIFICATIVA DE PRESTAMOS NOTARIALES, EL ARTICULO MUESTRA QUE LAS MUJERES PARTICIPARON EN EL MERCADO DE CREDITO COMO PRESTAMISTAS Y PRESTATARIAS. SIN EMBARGO, SU PARTICIPACION FUE MENOR QUE LA DE LOS HOMBRES. ADICIONALMENTE, LAS MUJERES RECIBIERON PRESTAMOS MAS PEQUENOS Y CON MAYORES TASAS DE INTERES QUE LOS HOMBRES. LA EVIDENCIA SUGIERE QUE LA MENOR PARTICIPACION DE LAS MUJERES COMO PRESTATARIAS Y EL MENOR TAMANO DE SUS PRESTAMOS SE DEBIERON EN GRAN MEDIDA A LA DISTRIBUCION DE COLATERAL. ADEMAS, EN GRAN MEDIDA LAS DIFERENCIAS EN TASAS DE INTERES SE EXPLICAN POR LAS DIFERENCIAS EN TAMANOS DE LOS PRESTAMOS.

WE FIND THAT THE REFORM HAD DIFFERENTIAL CREDIT EFFECTS ACROSS HOUSEHOLDS. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH ABOVE-AVERAGE ECONOMIC STATUS (MEASURED BY THE AREA OF CULTIVATED LAND, LEVEL OF INCOME, AND CONVENIENCE OF BANK VISITS), ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF THE REFORM. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH BELOW-AVERAGE ECONOMICS STATUS, RELIANCE ON INFORMAL CREDIT LESSENED. WE SHOW THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF LAND AS COLLATERAL MIGHT HAVE ENHANCED ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT. ANOTHER CHANNEL OF THE CREDIT EFFECTS WAS INCOME AND WEALTH. WE FIND THAT LAND TITLING HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THEIR NEED FOR INFORMAL CREDIT. FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH ABOVE-AVERAGE AREA OF CULTIVATED LAND, LAND TITLING INCREASED THEIR WEALTH AND MIGHT HAVE EXPANDED THEIR OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE BOTH THEIR CREDIT DEMAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS FORMAL CREDIT.","[ZHANG, LONGYAO] NANJING AGR UNIV, COLL FINANCE, 1 WEIGANG, NANJING 210095, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [CHENG, WENLI] MONASH UNIV, MONASH BUSINESS SCH, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; [CHENG, ENJIANG] VICTORIA UNIV, VICTORIA INST STRATEG ECON STUDIES, MELBOURNE, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; [WU, BI] MINIST AGR & RURAL AFFAIRS, RES CTR RURAL ECON, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.","ZHANG, LY (REPRINT AUTHOR), NANJING AGR UNIV, COLL FINANCE, 1 WEIGANG, NANJING 210095, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.","ZHANGLY@NJAU.EDU.CN","NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71773049]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71573125]; THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71773049].","ACEMOGLU D, 2001, AM ECON REV, V91, P1369, DOI 10.1257/AER.91.5.1369; ALI DA, 2014, J DEV ECON, V110, P262, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2013.12.009; BESLEY TJ, 2012, Q J ECON, V127, P237, DOI 10.1093/QJE/QJR056; BOUCHER SR, 2005, WORLD DEV, V33, P107, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2004.09.004; BOUCHER SR, 2008, AM J AGR ECON, V90, P409, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8276.2007.01116.X; BOUCHER SR, 2009, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V57, P609, DOI 10.1086/598763; CARTER MR, 2003, AM J AGR ECON, V85, P173, DOI 10.1111/1467-8276.00111; CHENG EJ, 2014, CHINA AGR ECON REV, V6, P295, DOI 10.1108/CAER-07-2012-0076; DE SOTO HERNANDO, 2000, MYSTERY CAPITAL WHY; DEININGER K, 2006, EUR ECON REV, V50, P1245, DOI 10.1016/J.EUROECOREV.2005.02.001; DEININGER K, 2014, WORLD DEV, V59, P505, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2013.10.009; DEININGER K, 2012, J DEV ECON, V99, P236, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2012.02.007; DEININGER K, 2009, WORLD BANK RES OBSER, V24, P233, DOI 10.1093/WBRO/LKP007; DEMSETZ H, 1967, AM ECON REV, V57, P347; DO QT, 2008, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V56, P531, DOI 10.1086/533549; DONALDSON JOHN A., 2015, CONT CHINESE POLITIC, V1, P51; DOWER PC, 2014, B INDONES ECON STUD, V50, P435, DOI 10.1080/00074918.2014.980376; EFENDIC A, 2011, EUR J POLIT ECON, V27, P586, DOI 10.1016/J.EJPOLECO.2010.12.003; FEDER G, 1998, LAND USE POLICY, V15, P25, DOI 10.1016/S0264-8377(97)00039-2; FEDER G, 1987, AM J AGR ECON, V69, P311, DOI 10.2307/1242281; GALIANI S, 2010, J PUBLIC ECON, V94, P700, DOI 10.1016/J.JPUBECO.2010.06.002; LAWRY S, 2017, J DEV EFFECT, V9, P61, DOI 10.1080/19439342.2016.1160947; NORTH D.C., 1973, RISE W WORLD NEW EC; PIZA C, 2016, J DEV EFFECT, V8, P129, DOI 10.1080/19439342.2015.1057859; PLACE F, 1998, LAND ECON, V74, P360, DOI 10.2307/3147118; VENDRYES T, 2014, J ECON SURV, V28, P971, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6419.2012.00743.X; WANG H, 2015, CHINA ECON REV, V36, P220, DOI 10.1016/J.CHIECO.2015.09.005","27",1,"1","7","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","APPL ECON","APPL.
