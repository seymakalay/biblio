THE ISSUE OF BANK LOANS AND ACCESS TO CREDIT HAS BEEN WIDELY COVERED IN STUDIES ON FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. COUNTLESS RESEARCH PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE BUSINESSES, FOR EXAMPLE, REGARDING FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND THE IMPACT OF DEBT FINANCE. THE CAUSES OF THESE DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT YET BEEN CLEARLY IDENTIFIED. IN THIS CONTEXT, ONE WONDERS WHETHER MALE AND FEMALE FIRMS WERE AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS IN THE SAME WAY, OR IF BANK-FIRM DYNAMICS FOLLOWED DIFFERENT TRENDS IN THE TWO CASES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE MAIN FINDINGS FROM AN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH BASED ON A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY INVOLVING A SAMPLE OF 300 (150 MALE AND 150 FEMALE) SOLE-PROPRIETORS AND OWNERS OF MICRO-ENTERPRISES LOCATED IN THE MARCHE REGION (CENTRAL ITALY). DATA WAS COLLECTED IN OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 2013 AND REFERS TO THE PERIOD 2008-2013. THE PURPOSE OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS TO UNDERSTAND IF MEN AND WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS ASKED FOR NEW BANK LOANS DURING THE CRISIS, AND IF THEY OBTAINED THE REQUIRED BANK LOANS UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS. MOREOVER WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF OTHER VARIABLES, OTHER THAN GENDER, COULD HAVE INFLUENCED ACCESS TO BANK CREDIT. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THAT FIRMS WERE VERY CAUTIOUS WITH ACCESS TO FINANCE DURING THE CRISIS. IN FACT, ONLY A FEW FIRMS ASKED FOR NEW BANK LOANS AND FEMALE FIRMS ASKED FOR BANK LOANS MORE RARELY THAN MALE FIRMS. IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS STUDIES, THIS ANALYSIS REVEALS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE BUSINESSES ON THE POSSIBILITY OF ATTAINING REQUESTED BANK LOANS. EVEN THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER VARIABLES IS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT.","[CESARONI, FRANCESCA MARIA] UNIV URBINO CARLO BO, DEPT ECON SOC & POLIT, URBINO, PU, ITALY.; [SENTUTI, ANNALISA] UNIV URBINO CARLO BO, DEPT ECON SOC & POLIT, BUSINESS ADM, URBINO, PU, ITALY.","CESARONI, FM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV URBINO CARLO BO, DEPT ECON SOC & POLIT, URBINO, PU, ITALY.","FRANCESCA.CESARONI@UNIURB.IT; ANNALISA.SENTUTI@UNIURB.IT",NA,NA,"ALESINA AF, 2013, J EUR ECON ASSOC, V11, P45, DOI 10.1111/J.1542-4774.2012.01100.X; ALSOS GA, 2006, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V30, P667, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6520.2006.00141.X; BELLUCCI A., 2009, 31 MOF; BUTTNER EH, 1989, J BUS VENTURING, V4, P249, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(89)90015-3; BYRNES JP, 1999, PSYCHOL BULL, V125, P367, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.125.3.367; CALCAGNINI G., 2014, ITALIAN EC J DEC; CARTER S, 2000, ENTERPRISE SMALL BUS; CARTER S, 2007, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V31, P427, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6520.2007.00181.X; CESARONI F.

THE STUDY USES NIGERIAN ENTERPRISE SURVEYS DATA FOR 2010 TO CONSTRUCT A DIRECT MEASURE OF CREDIT CONSTRAINT. FROM PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATIONS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT MATTERS AND HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. FIRMS THAT ARE CREDIT CONSTRAINED HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OUTPUT PER WORKER, CAPITAL PER WORKER, EMPLOYMENT OF LABOUR AND INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS FOR EXPANSION COMPARED TO FIRMS THAT ARE NOT CREDIT CONSTRAINED. THIS IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR WOMEN-OWNED ENTERPRISES AFTER ADJUSTING FOR BIAS IN THE ESTIMATIONS AND CONTROLLING FOR SAMPLING WEIGHTS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ONE WAY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA IS TO MAKE ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT LESS STRINGENT.

THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF RURAL CREDIT MARKETS, THE DETERMINANTS OF FARMER ACCESS TO THE MARKETS, THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CREDIT ACCESS IN VIETNAM AND BRIEFLY COMPARING WITH THOSE OF SOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS QUESTION IS ADDRESSED BY REVIEWING EXISTING LITERATURE AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, FOLLOWED BY A COMPREHENSIVE CASE STUDY IN VIETNAM. COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW WITH SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS ARE METHODS THAT ARE APPLIED IN THIS RESEARCH. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS INDICATE THE FEATURES OF VIETNAM MARKETS AS PARTICIPATED CONSTRAINTS, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, AND SEGMENTATION.

ACCESS TO FINANCE, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE POVERTY AND GENDER INEQUALITY. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, IS TO ASCERTAIN THE IMPACT OF ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT ON ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE. THE STUDY USES NIGERIAN ENTERPRISE SURVEYS DATA FOR 2010 TO CONSTRUCT A DIRECT MEASURE OF CREDIT CONSTRAINT. FROM PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATIONS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT MATTERS AND HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. FIRMS THAT ARE CREDIT CONSTRAINED HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OUTPUT PER WORKER, CAPITAL PER WORKER, EMPLOYMENT OF LABOUR AND INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS FOR EXPANSION COMPARED TO FIRMS THAT ARE NOT CREDIT CONSTRAINED. THIS IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR WOMEN-OWNED ENTERPRISES AFTER ADJUSTING FOR BIAS IN THE ESTIMATIONS AND CONTROLLING FOR SAMPLING WEIGHTS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ONE WAY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF ENTERPRISES IN NIGERIA IS TO MAKE ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT LESS STRINGENT.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT MAKES INDIVIDUALS APPEAR SELF-CONFIDENT AT WORK. WE DRAW ON ATTRIBUTION AND SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS LITERATURE TO THEORIZE ABOUT BOTH ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF APPEARING SELF-CONFIDENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN MALE-DOMINATED PROFESSIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT PERFORMANCE IS ONE DETERMINANT OF WHETHER INDIVIDUALS ARE SEEN AS CONFIDENT AT WORK AND THAT THIS EFFECT IS MODERATED BY GENDER. WE FURTHER PROPOSE THAT SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE INCREASES THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS EXERT INFLUENCE IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. HOWEVER, FOR WOMEN, APPEARING SELF-CONFIDENT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GAIN INFLUENCE. IN CONTRAST TO MEN, WOMEN IN ADDITION ARE ""REQUIRED"" TO BE PROSOCIALLY ORIENTED. MULTISOURCE, TIME-LAG DATA FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL COMPANY SHOWED THAT PERFORMANCE HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE ON ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCE WAS MODERATED BY GENDER AND PROSOCIAL ORIENTATION, AS PREDICTED. THROUGH SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE, JOB PERFORMANCE DIRECTLY ENABLED MEN TO EXERT INFLUENCE IN THEIR ORGANIZATION. IN CONTRAST, HIGH-PERFORMING WOMEN GAINED INFLUENCE ONLY WHEN THEIR SELF-CONFIDENCE APPEARANCE WAS COUPLED WITH PROSOCIAL ORIENTATION. OUR RESULTS HAVE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR GENDER EQUALITY AND LEADERSHIP. THEY SUGGEST THAT HR AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SHOULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN BUILDING MORE DIVERSITY-FRIENDLY ORGANIZATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, ENSURING THAT THE SAME JOB REQUIREMENTS-EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT-ARE APPLIED TO BOTH FEMALE AND MALE EMPLOYEES IS CRUCIAL FOR FAIR INDIVIDUAL OUTCOMES IN ORGANIZATIONS.","[GUILLEN, LAURA] EUROPEAN SCH MANAGEMENT & TECHNOL, SCHLOSSPL 1, D-10178 BERLIN, GERMANY.; [MAYO, MARGARITA] IE BUSINESS SCH, LEADERSHIP, MADRID, SPAIN.; [KARELAIA, NATALIA] INSEAD, FONTAINEBLEAU, FRANCE.","GUILLEN, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), EUROPEAN SCH MANAGEMENT & TECHNOL, SCHLOSSPL 1, D-10178 BERLIN, GERMANY.","LAURA.GUILLEN@ESMT.ORG",NA,NA,"ABELE AE, 2007, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V93, P751, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.93.5.751; ANDERSON C, 2009, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V96, P491, DOI 10.1037/A0014201; ANGWIN J., 1998, SAN FRANCISCO CHRON, P4; ANTONAKIS J, 2010, LEADERSHIP QUART, V21, P1086, DOI 10.1016/J.LEAQUA.2010.10.010; ARVEY RD, 1998, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V49, P141, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.49.1.141; ASTIN AW, 1997, AM FRESHMAN 30 YEAR; ATWATER LE, 2002, HUM RESOURCE MANAGE, V41, P193, DOI 10.1002/HRM.10031; AWAMLEH R, 1999, LEADERSHIP QUART, V10, P345, DOI 10.1016/S1048-9843(99)00022-3; BAKAN D., 1966, DUALITY HUMAN EXISTE; BANDURA A., 1977, SOCIAL LEARNING THEO; BANDURA A., 1997, SELF EFFICACY EXERCI; BASS BM, 1990, ORGAN DYN, V18, P19, DOI 10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S; BAUER DJ, 2005, MULTIVAR BEHAV RES, V40, P373, DOI 10.1207/S15327906MBR4003_5; BAUER RA, 1964, AM PSYCHOL, V19, P319, DOI 10.1037/H0042851; BECKER TE, 2005, ORGAN RES METHODS, V8, P274, DOI 10.1177/1094428105278021; BENTLER PM, 1996, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V47, P563, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.47.1.563; BIDDLE B, 1979, ROLE THEORY EXPECTAT; BIERNAT M, 1997, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V72, P544, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.544; BOLLEN KA, 1989, SOCIOL METHOD RES, V17, P303, DOI 10.1177/0049124189017003004; BORMAN WC, 1997, HUM RESOUR MANAGE R, V7, P299, DOI 10.1016/S1053-4822(97)90010-3; BORMAN WC, 1993, PERSONNEL SELECTION, V71, P71, DOI DOI 10.1007/SPRINGERREFERENCE_7472; CARLI LL, 1995, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V68, P1030, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.68.6.1030; CARLI LL, 2001, J SOC ISSUES, V57, P725, DOI 10.1111/0022-4537.00238; CARLI LL, 1990, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V59, P941, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941; CASCIARO T, 2008, ADMIN SCI QUART, V53, P655, DOI 10.2189/ASQU.53.4.655; CASTELLS M., 1999, INFORM TECHNOLOGY GL, V114; CATALYST, 2015, WOM MAL IND OCC; CATALYST, 2016, WOM S P 500 CO; CECH EA, 2010, SOC PROBL, V57, P371, DOI 10.1525/SP.2010.57.3.371; CHERYAN S, 2017, PSYCHOL BULL, V143, P1, DOI 10.1037/BUL0000052; CITRIN J, 1986, BRIT J POLIT SCI, V16, P431, DOI 10.1017/S0007123400004518; CONGER JA, 1987, ACAD MANAGE REV, V12, P637, DOI 10.2307/258069; CORRELL S., 2016, HARVARD BUSINESS REV; CRAIG S.

WHILE MANY OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS CAN ALSO BE LINKED TO THE INFERIOR STATUS OF WOMEN IN MANY AFRICAN SOCIETIES, THEIR UNDERESTIMATION AS ECONOMIC AGENTS, AS WELL AS GENDER BIAS EMBEDDED IN TRIBAL AND CULTURAL NORMS, THE FINDING SHOWED GENDER IS EXTRANEOUS TO THE PRACTICES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHEN DEALING WITH FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS.","UNIV WALES INST UWIC, CARDIFF, S GLAM, WALES.","ADESUA-LINCOLN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WALES INST UWIC, CARDIFF, S GLAM, WALES.","BLINCOLN@UWIC.AC.UK",NA,NA,"ADEREMI HO, 2008, AFR J BUS MANAGE, V2, P165; ALDRICH HE, 1996, ENTREPRENEURSHIP GLO; ANDERSON S., 2001, RR00201 SMALL BUS SE; ANNA AL, 2000, J BUS VENTURING, V15, P279, DOI 10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00012-3; BELL J, 1997, DOING YOUR RES PROJE; BIRLEY S, 1994, J BUS VENTURING, V9, P7, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(94)90024-8; BIRLEY S., 1987, AM J SMALL BUSINESS, V12, P27; BROWN RC, 1997, INT C WOM SMES STELL; BROWN S.A., 1989, CANADIAN BANKER, P32; BRUSH C, 1990, LOCAL INITIATIVES JO; BRUSH C.G., 1992, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V16, P5, DOI DOI 10.1177/104225879201600401; BRUSH C.G., 2004, CLEARING HURDLES WOM; BRUSH CG, 2001, [NO TITLE CAPTURED]; BUTTNER EH, 1989, J BUS VENTURING, V4, P249, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(89)90015-3; BUTTNER EH, 1997, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V35, P34; CARTER S., 1998, ENTREP REGION DEV, V10, P225, DOI DOI 10.1080/08985629800000013; CARTER S, 1992, WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS; CARTER S, 2009, ACCESS FINANCE NATL; CARTER S., 2000, ENTERPRISE SMALL BUS, P166; CARTER S, 2007, GENDER ENTREPRENEURS; CHEN MA, 2002, 20022 ILO EMPL SECT; CHURCHILL NC, 1983, HARVARD BUS REV, V61, P30; COLEMAN S, 2000, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V38, P37; COLEMAN S., 2002, J DEV ENTREPRENEURSH, V7, P151; COLEMAN S, 2007, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V45, P303, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-627X.2007.00214.X; CROMIE S, 1985, INT SMALL BUS J, V3, P3; DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, 2005, S AFR WOM ENTR BURG; DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, 2005, SMALL BUS SERV PROM; DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES INC, 2005, GEND PROP GROWTH; DUBINI P, 1989, J BUS VENTURING, V4, P11, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(89)90031-1; DUCHENAUT B, 1997, OECD C WOM ENTR SMAL; FIELDEN SL, 2003, J SMALL BUSINESS ENT, V10, P152, DOI DOI 10.1108/14626000310473184; FULLER-LOVE N, 2008, FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS; GATEWOOD ELIZABETH, 2002, VENTURE CAPITAL, V4, P305, DOI DOI 10.1080/1369106022000024897; GOSCILO H., 1997, DEHEXING SEX RUSSIAN; GUNNERED BERG N., 2000, INT SMALL BUS J, V18, P38, DOI DOI 10.1177/0266242600182002; GUZMAN J.C., 2007, GENDER ENTREPRENEURS; HISRICH R., 1983, FRONTIERS ENTREPRENE, P255; HISRICH RD, 1984, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V22, P36; HUTCHINSON P., 1986, SURVIVAL SMALL FIRM; KIBANJA GM, 2009, J AFR BUS, V10, P105, DOI 10.1080/15228910802701544; KIRK J, 2006, J EMPLOYMENT COUNS, V43, P50, DOI 10.1002/J.2161-1920.2006.TB00006.X; KOLVEREID L., 1993, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V31, P42; MADICHIE NO, 2009, J AFR BUS, V10, P51, DOI 10.1080/15228910802701361; MAHEDA D, 1996, ACTA ACAD, V29, P70; MALHOTRA A, 2002, MEASURING WOMENS EMP; MARLOW S., 2002, INT J ENTREP INNOV, V3, P83, DOI DOI 10.5367/000000002101299088; MARLOW S, 2005, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V29, P699; MORDI C, 2010, ROLE CULTURAL VALUES; NICHTER S, 2009, SMALL FIRM GROWTH DE; PARKER R., 1995, AFRICAN TECHNICAL DE; PHIRI T, 2003, 6 MCGILL C INT ENTR; RICHARDSON P, 2004, 47 SEED INT LAB ORG; RIDING AL, 1990, J BUS VENTURING, V5, P327, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(90)90009-I; RUTASHOBYA L.

THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION THAT BECAUSE NON-STATE-OWNED FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER BANK DISCRIMINATION FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY TEND TO ADDRESS THEIR FINANCING DISADVANTAGES BY BUILDING ECONOMIC BONDS WITH BANKS. WE ALSO FIND THAT AMONG NON-STATE-OWNED FIRMS, THOSE THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT BANK OWNERSHIP HAVE LOWER INTEREST EXPENSES, AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO INCREASE CASH HOLDINGS BUT MORE LIKELY TO OBTAIN SHORT-TERM LOANS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICY IS TIGHT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE FIRMS BUILDING ECONOMIC BONDS WITH BANKS CAN ENJOY BENEFITS SUCH AS LOWER FINANCIAL EXPENSES AND BETTER LENDING TERMS DURING DIFFICULT TIMES. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT NON-STATE-OWNED FIRMS WITH SIGNIFICANT BANK OWNERSHIP HAVE BETTER OPERATING PERFORMANCE. OVERALL, WE FIND THAT FIRMS CAN REDUCE DISCRIMINATION THROUGH HOLDING BANK OWNERSHIP.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A MULTI-STAGE SAMPLING OF 548 CINNAMON HOUSEHOLDS AND A HECKMAN SELECTION MODEL WERE APPLIED TO EXAMINE THEIR CREDIT ACCESS CONSTRAINTS. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH COOPERATIVES, ENTERPRISES, BANKS AND RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE FURTHER CONDUCTED TO EXPLAIN THE CREDIT GAP. FINDINGS IN THE TOTAL 52.74 PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT RECEIVED CREDIT, 24.56 PERCENT OF THEM RECEIVED AN INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CREDIT AS REGISTERED. IN ADDITION, 35.77 PERCENT OF TOTAL HOUSEHOLDS ARE CREDIT RATIONED. ALTHOUGH ALL ENTERPRISES AND COOPERATIVES HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN APPLYING FOR CREDIT AS LONG AS THEY HAVE COLLATERAL, NONE OF THEM RECEIVED THE FULL CREDIT AMOUNT REQUESTED. THE CREDIT AMOUNT RECEIVED SATISFIED 80.64, 43.03 AND 44.28 PERCENT OF THE DEMAND BY HOUSEHOLDS, COOPERATIVES AND ENTERPRISES, RESPECTIVELY. THE LACK OF VALUABLE COLLATERAL ASSETS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR EXPLAINING THIS CREDIT GAP. MOREOVER, MEMBERSHIP IN A FARMER-BASED UNION OR OWNERSHIP OF A BANK ACCOUNT INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF ACCESS TO CREDIT. EDUCATED HOUSEHOLD HEADS WITH A LARGER FARM SIZE AND THE KINH ETHNIC MAJORITY ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGER AMOUNT OF CREDIT. HOUSEHOLDS WITH CONVENTIONAL CINNAMON FARMING, MORE DEPENDENTS AND UNION NON-MEMBERSHIP ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CREDIT RATIONED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - A REFORM ON COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT, FACILITATING ACCESS TO BANK ACCOUNTS, CAPACITY BUILDING FOR LOCAL FARMER-BASED UNIONS, ORGANIC CERTIFICATION, GRANTING LAND USE RIGHTS AND FACILITATING A PLATFORM TO SHARE RELIABLE INFORMATION BETWEEN RELEVANT ACTORS ARE NEEDED TO BRIDGE THE CREDIT GAP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT ACCESS CONSTRAINTS BY KEY ACTORS IN A MEDICINAL PLANT VALUE CHAIN THAT WAS INSUFFICIENTLY DISCUSSED BY PREVIOUS STUDIES IN THE FIELD.","[LUAN, DO XUAN] NGUYEN UNIV AGR & FORESTRY, FAC ECON & RURAL DEV, THAI NGUYEN, VIETNAM.","LUAN, DX (REPRINT AUTHOR), NGUYEN UNIV AGR & FORESTRY, FAC ECON & RURAL DEV, THAI NGUYEN, VIETNAM.","DOXUANLUAN@TUAF.EDU.VN","VIETNAM NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (NAFOSTED)NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (NAFOSTED) [502.01-2016.12]","THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY VIETNAM NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (NAFOSTED) UNDER GRANT NO. 502.01-2016.12.","AGARWAL SR, 2017, CARD VASC BIOL, P17, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-54579-0_2; ANGELINO A, 2017, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V14, DOI 10.3390/IJERPH14090976; ASANTE-ADDO C, 2017, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V77, P239, DOI 10.1108/AFR-02-2016-0010; AWUNYO-VITOR D, 2014, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V74, P364, DOI 10.1108/AFR-01-2013-0004; AYUYA OI, 2015, WORLD DEV, V67, P27, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2014.10.005; BIYASE M, 2017, STUD U BABES BOLYAI, V62, P50, DOI [10.1515/SUBBOEC-2017-0004, DOI 10.1515/SUBBOEC-2017-0004]; BONNET J, 2016, APPL ECON, V48, P5563, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2016.1181829; BOUCHER SR, 2005, WORLD DEV, V33, P107, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2004.09.004; BOUCHER SR, 2008, AM J AGR ECON, V90, P409, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8276.2007.01116.X; BUN MJG, 2002, ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND, V150, P320; CHANDIO A.A., 2017, J SAUDI SOC AGR SCI, V18, P348; CHANDIO AA, 2017, COGENT ECON FINANC, V5, DOI 10.1080/23322039.2017.1369383; CONNING JONATHAN, 2007, HDB AGR EC, V3, P2857; CUI YJ, 2017, J INTERDISCIP MATH, V20, P1179, DOI 10.1080/09720502.2017.1334361; NGUYEN CV, 2017, SOC INDIC RES, V134, P93, DOI 10.1007/S11205-016-1413-3; DE QUIDT J, 2016, J DEV ECON, V121, P217, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2014.11.006; LUAN DX, 2016, J RURAL STUD, V47, P186, DOI 10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2016.08.001; DURGUNER S, 2017, J INT FINANC MARK I, V50, P98, DOI 10.1016/J.INTFIN.2017.09.007; EVEN B., 2017, ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT & MICROFINANCE, V28, P28, DOI 10.3362/1755-1986.16-00034; FU H., 2018, EVOLUTION AGR CREDIT, P179; GAN C., 2017, MICROFINANCE ASIA; GSO, 2016, STAT HDB; GSO, 2017, STAT HDB VIETN; VU HNT, 2018, CURR MICROBIOL, V75, P1247, DOI 10.1007/S00284-018-1517-X; HECKMAN J., 2001, ECONOMETRIC EVALUATI; DINH HH, 2017, J FOREST ECON, V29, P14, DOI 10.1016/J.JFE.2017.08.001; HAU HT, 2017, ECON ANN-XXI, V164, P49, DOI 10.21003/EA.V164-11; HOQUE M.Z., 2016, J GLOBAL ENTREPRENEU, V6, P1; HUNG P.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IN 2010, THE CHINESE NATIONAL SURVEY REPORTED THE DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS. USING THIS SET OF SURVEY DATA, THE AUTHORS OBTAIN A SAMPLE OF 4,330 CHINESE FAMILY FIRMS AND EMPLOY THE TOBIT REGRESSION APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF BANK LOANS AND THE RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND OF ENTREPRENEURS. IN ADDITION, THE AUTHORS USE THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE ENDOGENEITY ISSUE. FINDINGS BASED ON THE DATA FROM THE 2010 NATIONAL SURVEY, THE AUTHORS DOCUMENT THAT THE AMOUNT OF BANK LOANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR CHINESE FAMILY FIRMS WITH RELIGIOUS ENTREPRENEURS THAN FOR THEIR COUNTERPARTS. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT RELIGIOUS INDIVIDUALS ARE INCLINED TO BE MORE ETHICAL AND HONEST AND CHINESE FAMILY FIRMS WITH RELIGIOUS ENTREPRENEURS TRANSFER SOFT INFORMATION TO BANKS, AND EVENTUALLY LENDERS FAVOR RELIGIOUS ENTREPRENEURS WITH MORE BANK LOANS.

WE DETERMINE INDIVIDUAL FIRM'S POLITICAL CONNECTIONS BY IDENTIFYING WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OWNS SHARES IN THE FIRM, WHETHER POLITICIANS ARE ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND WHETHER HIGHLY-RANKED MANAGERS PERSONALLY KNOW ANY POLITICIAN. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED EFFECTS OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ON FIRMS FINANCING AND PERFORMANCE, WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN LARGE FIRMS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMES), BETWEEN THE LOAN APPROVAL AND AMOUNT SETTING PROCESSES, AND BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. WE FIND THAT POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BORROW FROM STATE-OWNED BANKS. MOREOVER, BEING CONNECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT RAISES THE PROBABILITY THAT A FIRM CAN RECEIVE THE FULL LOAN AMOUNT IT APPLIED FOR. THE IMPROVEMENT IN ACCESS TO FINANCE FROM POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IS MORE PROMINENT FOR SMES THAN FOR LARGE FIRMS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH IMPROVEMENT MOSTLY COMES FROM PERSONAL CONNECTIONS WITH POLITICIANS RATHER THAN MORE FORMAL CONNECTIONS MEASURED BY THE GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OR POLITICIANS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FINALLY, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTED LENDING ON ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY OF CAPITAL AND FIND WEAK EVIDENCE THAT SCARCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE LIKELY CHANNELED BY STATE-OWNED BANKS TO POLITICALLY CONNECTED BUT LESS PRODUCTIVE FIRMS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IN THIS PAPER, TAKING THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN EMPLOYED FROM THE END OF 2012 AS AN EXOGENOUS SHOCK, THE AUTHORS DESIGN A QUASI-EXPERIMENT DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE APPROACH TO EXAMINE HOW THE LOSS AND FAILURE OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IMPACTS PRIVATE FIRMS' DEBT FINANCING. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE LOSS AND FAILURE OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS FOLLOWING THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE 18TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS CAUSES THE YEARLY NEW DEBT RATIOS OF TREATMENT FIRMS WITH POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO DECREASE, RELATIVE TO THOSE OF CONTROL FIRMS WITHOUT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. THIS OUTCOME IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR PROVINCES WITH MORE CADRES EXCLUDED IN THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE 18TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS, WHICH RENDERED POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSE CONNECTIONS WITH CENTRAL OR PROVINCIAL CADRES. TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT FOLLOWING THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE 18TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS, POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS LIMIT RENT-SEEKING ACTIVITIES, WHEREAS RESOURCE ACQUISITION IS WEAKENED. THE AUTHORS ALSO FIND THAT THE IMPACT OF THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE 18TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS ON THE DEBT FINANCING OF POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS, RELATIVE TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS, IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR GROUPS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF INFORMATION ASYMMETRY AND FOR LESS EXPLICIT GUARANTEE GROUPS. FINALLY, POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DOMINATED BY INTERNAL FUNDS IN DEALING WITH A LOSS OF ADVANTAGES IN DEBT FINANCING, COMPARED WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS WITHOUT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS IN THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THE LOSS OR FAILURE OF PREVIOUS POLITICAL CONNECTIONS FOLLOWING XI'S ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN MAKE POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS LOSE THE ADVANTAGES IN DEBT FINANCING THROUGH THE RENT-SEEKING, RESOURCE ACQUISITION, INFORMATION ASYMMETRY, IMPLICIT GUARANTEE CHANNELS, WHICH PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE FOR RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF THE ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN SINCE THE 18TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS ON PRIVATE FIRMS' FINANCING BEHAVIORS VIA THE LOSS OR FAILURE OF EXISTING POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE FINDINGS IN THE STUDY WILL HAVE SOME INSPIRATION FOR POLICY MAKERS AND ENTREPRENEUR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY PROVIDES NEW EVIDENCE ON THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS OF XI'S ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN ON PRIVATE FIRM'S DEBT FINANCING BETWEEN POLITICALLY CONNECTED AND UNCONNECTED FIRMS.","[HU, YIMING] SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING, SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [XU, MINGXIA] SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, ANTAI COLL ECON & MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA.","XU, MX (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, ANTAI COLL ECON & MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA.","XUMINGXIA552@HOTMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"AMIHUD Y, 2002, J FINANC MARK, V5, P31, DOI 10.1016/S1386-4181(01)00024-6; AMIHUD Y, 1997, J FINANC ECON, V45, P365, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(97)00021-4; [ANONYMOUS], 2016, CHINA DAILY; BAGEHOT WALTER, 1971, FINANCIAL ANAL J, V27, P12, DOI [DOI 10.2469/FAJ.V27.N2.12, 10.2469/FAJ.V27.N2.12]; BERGER AN, 1995, J BUS, V68, P351, DOI 10.1086/296668; BHARATH ST, 2009, REV FINANC STUD, V22, P3211, DOI 10.1093/RFS/HHN076; BLISS MA, 2012, J BANK FINANC, V36, P2344, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2012.04.012; CAI HB, 2011, J LAW ECON, V54, P55, DOI 10.1086/651201; CHARUMILIND C, 2006, J BUS, V79, P181, DOI 10.1086/497410; CHEN C.R., 2015, J BANK FINANC, V80, P71; CHEN YS, 2018, J CORP FINANC, V51, P125, DOI 10.1016/J.JCORPFIN.2018.05.005; CLAESSENS S, 2008, J FINANC ECON, V88, P554, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.11.003; DING H., 2017, WORKING PAPER; FACCIO M, 2006, AM ECON REV, V96, P369, DOI 10.1257/000282806776157704; FAN JPH, 2008, J COMP ECON, V36, P343, DOI 10.1016/J.JCE.2008.05.001; FANG L.H., 2018, 25098 NBER; FRASER DR, 2006, J BANK FINANC, V30, P1291, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2005.05.008; GUIDA R, 2017, EUR FINANC MANAG, V23, P807, DOI 10.1111/EUFM.12109; JOHNSON S, 2003, J FINANC ECON, V67, P351, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(02)00255-6; KHWAJA AI, 2005, Q J ECON, V120, P1371, DOI 10.1162/003355305775097524; KORAJCZYK RA, 2003, J FINANC ECON, V68, P75, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(02)00249-0; LEARY MT, 2009, J FINANC, V64, P1143, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.2009.01461.X; LI B., 2017, CHINAS ANTICORRUPTIO; LIN C, 2016, 22001 NBER; MATHUR I, 2011, ACCOUNT FINANC, V51, P252, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-629X.2010.00386.X; PASTOR L, 2003, J POLIT ECON, V111, P642; PENG HF, 2017, ACCOUNT FINANC, V57, P1481, DOI 10.1111/ACFI.12331; SHEN J., 2015, BANK LOAN SUPPLY COR, DOI [10.2139/SSRN.2547860, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.2547860]; TIROLE J, 2006, THEORY OF CORPORATE FINANCE, P447; WANG LH, 2015, J BANK FINANC, V55, P92, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2015.02.015; ZHOU L., 2007, EC RES J, V7, P36","31",0,"0","3","3","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","2044-1398","2044-1401","CHINA FINANC REV INT","CHINA FINANC.

THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IN GENERAL SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS, SINCE CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ARE FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY DISTORT THE LABOUR SUPPLY DECISIONS OF RECENTLY ARRIVED IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.","UNIV MELBOURNE, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA.","WORSWICK, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MELBOURNE, PARKVILLE, VIC 3052, AUSTRALIA.",NA,NA,NA,"ABBOTT MG, 1993, CAN J ECON, V26, P505, DOI 10.2307/135884; ALTONJI JG, 1986, J POLIT ECON, V94, PS176, DOI 10.1086/261403; BAKER M, 1997, AM ECON REV, V87, P705; BAKER M, 1994, J LABOR ECON, V12, P369, DOI 10.1086/298349; BALL L, 1990, ECON INQ, V28, P706, DOI 10.1111/J.1465-7295.1990.TB00827.X; BEACH CM, 1993, CAN PUBLIC POL, V19, P36, DOI 10.2307/3551789; BERNHARDT D, 1990, J LABOR ECON, V8, P145, DOI 10.1086/298240; BLOOM DE, 1991, IMMIGRATION TRADE LA; BORJAS GJ, 1985, J LABOR ECON, V3, P463, DOI 10.1086/298065; BORJAS GJ, 1991, J LABOR ECON, V9, P123, DOI 10.1086/298262; BROWNING M, 1985, ECONOMETRICA, V53, P503, DOI 10.2307/1911653; CAMPBELL M, 1994, GLOBE MAIL 0310; CHISWICK BR, 1978, J POLIT ECON, V86, P897, DOI 10.1086/260717; DULEEP HO, 1993, IND LABOR RELATIONS, V46, P64; FORTIN NM, 1995, J LABOR ECON, V13, P524, DOI 10.1086/298384; HECKMAN JJ, 1979, ECONOMETRICA, V47, P153, DOI 10.2307/1912352; HECKMAN JJ, 1980, REV ECON STUD, V47, P47, DOI 10.2307/2297103; JAKUBSON G, 1988, J LABOR ECON, V6, P302, DOI 10.1086/298185; LALONDE R, 1992, AEA PAPERS P, P297; LONG JE, 1980, J POLIT ECON, V88, P620, DOI 10.1086/260892; MACURDY TE, 1981, J POLIT ECON, V89, P1059, DOI 10.1086/261023; MACURDY TE, 1983, INT ECON REV, V24, P265, DOI 10.2307/2648746; MADDALA GS, 1983, ECONOMETRIC SOC MO 3, V51, P465; MCDONALD JT, 1998, IND LABOR RELATIONS; REILLY KT, 1994, J LABOR ECON, V12, P460, DOI 10.1086/298352; RUNKLE DE, 1991, J MONETARY ECON, V27, P73, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(91)90005-9; SIMPSON J, 1994, GLOBE MAIL 1026; WHITE H, 1980, ECONOMETRICA, V48, P817, DOI 10.2307/1912934; WORSWICK C, 1996, CAN PUBLIC POL, V22, P378, DOI 10.2307/3551455; WORSWICK C, 1995, 488 U MELB DEP EC; ZELDES SP, 1989, J POLIT ECON, V97, P305, DOI 10.1086/261605","31",14,"14","0","3","UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC","TORONTO","JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA","0008-4085",NA,"CAN J ECON","CAN.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - USING THE DIRECT ELICITATION METHOD (DEM), THE AUTHORS CONSIDER BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CREDIT RATIONING. FINDINGS - EMPIRICAL EVIDENCES CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF HOUSEHOLD HEAD'S AGE, GENDER AND EDUCATION TO HOUSEHOLD'S LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CREDIT CONSTRAINED. IN ADDITION, HOUSEHOLDS WHO HAVE ADVANTAGES IN FARM LAND SIZE, LABOUR RESOURCES AND NON-FARM INCOME ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CREDIT CONSTRAINED. POOR HOUSEHOLDS ARE OBSERVED TO REMAIN RESTRICTED BY FORMAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS. RESULTS FROM THE ENDOGENOUS SWITCHING REGRESSION MODEL SUGGEST THAT CREDIT CONSTRAINTS NEGATIVELY IMPACT HOUSEHOLD'S CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA AND INFORMAL CREDIT CAN ACT AS A SUBSTITUTE TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF FORMAL CREDIT CONSTRAINTS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - ONE LIMITATION ARISES FROM THE USAGE OF THE DEM TO IDENTIFY CREDIT CONSTRAINED HOUSEHOLDS. THE METHOD CANNOT DETECT EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE CONSTRAINTS. ANOTHER LIMITATION IS THE INABILITY OF CROSS-SECTION DATA TO CAPTURE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSEHOLD WELFARE. FINALLY, CAUSES OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS FROM THE LENDER'S VIEW CANNOT BE OBSERVED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO ENHANCE THE CREDIT ALLOCATION REGIME TO REDUCE THE TRANSACTION COST AND PROVIDE TARGET HOUSEHOLDS WITH SUFFICIENT CREDIT. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT HIGH TRANSACTION COST AND THE MISMATCH BETWEEN CREDIT DEMAND AND SUPPLY STEMMING FROM INFORMATION ASYMMETRY. THE GOVERNMENT CAN HELP FORMAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REDUCE INFORMATION COST BY ENCOURAGING THE ACTIVE ROLE OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS WOMEN UNIONS, YOUTH UNIONS AND VETERAN UNIONS IN BRIDGING RURAL FARM HOUSEHOLDS WITH FORMAL LENDERS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES FOCUSING ON DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON RURAL FARM HOUSEHOLDS. TO THE BEST OF THE KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS NO STUDY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ON RURAL FARM HOUSEHOLD WELFARE PARTICULARLY IN VIETNAM. IN ADDITION, THE STUDIES RELATED TO CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ONLY CONSIDERED FULL QUANTITY RATIONING (HOUSEHOLDS APPLIED FOR THE LOAN BUT WERE REJECTED), OMITTING THE CASE OF PARTLY QUANTITY RATIONING (LOAN OBTAINED BY THE BORROWERS IS LESS THAN THEIR DEMAND) AND SELF-RATIONING.","[MINH CHAU TRAN; GAN, CHRISTOPHER; HU, BAIDING] LINCOLN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING FINANCE & ECON, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND.","GAN, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), LINCOLN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING FINANCE & ECON, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND.","CHRISTOPHER.GAN@LINCOLN.AC.NZ",NA,NA,"ALI DA, 2014, J AFR ECON, V23, P493, DOI 10.1093/JAE/EJU008; ALI DA, 2014, J DEV STUD, V50, P649, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2014.887687; BAIYEGUNHI LJS, 2010, AFR J AGR RES, V5, P2243; BARSLUND M, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P485, DOI 10.1080/00220380801980798; BOSE P, 1998, J DEV ECON, V56, P265, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(98)00066-2; BOUCHER SR, 2009, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V57, P609, DOI 10.1086/598763; BRAVERMAN A, 1986, WORLD DEV, V14, P1253, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(86)90104-X; BURGESS R, 2005, AM ECON REV, V95, P780, DOI 10.1257/0002828054201242; CAMPBELL J, 1989, REV ECON STUD, V56, P357, DOI 10.2307/2297552; CHAUDHURI K, 2012, APPL ECON, V44, P803, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2010.524627; COUDOUEL A, 2002, POVERTY MEASUREMENT; CUONG NV, 2008, DEV ECON, V46, P151, DOI 10.1111/J.1746-1049.2008.00061.X; NGUYEN CV, 2014, DEV ECON, V52, P154, DOI 10.1111/DEVE.12042; DE BRAUW A, 2007, AM J AGR ECON, V89, P430, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8276.2006.00989.X; DONG F., 2010, EFFECTS CREDIT CONST; DUFHUES T., 2005, 01 RES AGR APPL EC; DUONG PB, 2002, WORLD DEV, V30, P319; FEDER G, 1990, AM J AGR ECON, V72, P1151, DOI 10.2307/1242524; FENWICK L.

SMALL AND MICRO ENTERPRISES (SMES) ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ELIMINATED THAN LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES UNDER CREDIT RATIONING. HOWEVER, SMES PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND GROWTH OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SO, IT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO STUDY THE REASONS WHY SMES ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO CREDIT CONSTRAINTS. BY CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN SMES AND LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES, WE ESTABLISHED A THEORETICAL MODEL WITH ENDOGENOUS ENTERPRISE SIZE, AND BY CONSIDERING BANKS' SCREENING PRINCIPLES BEFORE AND AFTER THE LOAN APPROVAL, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE MICRO-MECHANISM IN WHICH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT AVAILABILITY BETWEEN SMES AND LARGE AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES. OUR CONCLUSION INDICATES THAT CREDIT RATIONING IN SMES IS THE RESULT OF THE RATIONAL CHOICE BY BANKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROFIT MAXIMIZATION.","[JIN, YUHUAN; ZHANG, SHENG] XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH PUBL POLICY & ADM, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.","JIN, YH; ZHANG, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH PUBL POLICY & ADM, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.","YUHUANJIN628@STU.XJTU.EDU.CN; ZHANGSHENG@STU.XJTU.EDU.CN","POLICY RESEARCH ON ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN SHAANXI PROVINCE [2016KRZ003]","POLICY RESEARCH ON ACCELERATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN SHAANXI PROVINCE: 2016KRZ003.","ATIENO ROSEMARY, 2001, 111 AFR EC RES CONS; AZIZ J., 2002, IMF WORK PAPER, DOI [10.5089/9781451859874.001, DOI 10.5089/9781451859874.001]; BALTENSPERGER E, 1978, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V10, P170, DOI 10.2307/1991869; BANERJEE A.V., 2008, SOC SCI ELECT PUBLIS, V81, P572; BANERJEE A, 2015, AM ECON J-APPL ECON, V7, P22, DOI 10.1257/APP.20130533; BAUMOL W.J., 2009, SOC SCI ELECT PUBL, V58, P64; BECK T, 2005, J FINANC, V60, P137, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.2005.00727.X; BECK T, 2004, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V36, P627, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2004.0039; BECK T, 2006, J INT MONEY FINANC, V25, P932, DOI 10.1016/J.JIMONFIN.2006.07.005; BELONGIA MT, 1990, AM J AGR ECON, V72, P769, DOI 10.2307/1243053; CHAN YS, 1985, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V17, P84, DOI 10.2307/1992508; COASE RH, 1937, ECONOMICA-NEW SER, V4, P386, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-0335.1937.TB00002.X; DANG CY, 2018, J BANK FINANC, V86, P159, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2017.09.006; DEMIRGUC-KUNT A, 1998, J FINANC, V53, P2107, DOI 10.1111/0022-1082.00084; DEMIRGUCKUNT A., 2010, POLICY RES WORK PAP, V22, P483; DOH S, 2014, RES POLICY, V43, P1557, DOI 10.1016/J.RESPOL.2014.05.001; GELOS RG, 2002, J DEV ECON, V67, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(01)00175-4; GOU Q, 2014, J FINANC RES, V8, P1; GROSSMAN SJ, 1986, J POLIT ECON, V94, P691, DOI 10.1086/261404; GUAN JC, 2009, RES POLICY, V38, P802, DOI 10.1016/J.RESPOL.2008.12.009; GUAN JC, 2015, RES POLICY, V44, P273, DOI 10.1016/J.RESPOL.2014.09.001; HALME M, 2014, BUS STRATEG ENVIRON, V23, P547, DOI 10.1002/BSE.1801; HUGHES A., 2000, 180 U CAMBR ESRC CTR; JIANCHENG GUAN, 2002, PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT JOURNAL, V43, P30; JIN XL, 2015, BIG DATA RES, V2, P59, DOI 10.1016/J.BDR.2015.01.006; KARNANI A., 2007, RETRIEV FEBR, V18, P2009; KELLOGG C.

ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT FARMERS WHO USED CREDIT WERE YOUNGER (AVERAGE: 47 YEARS OLD), AND THAT CULTIVATED FARM SIZES (AVERAGE: 3.8 HA) WERE LARGER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE STATISTICAL MODELS SHOWED THAT THE INTEREST RATE,FARM EXPENDITURE, THE AMOUNT BORROWED FROM ALTERNATIVE SOURCES, FARM SIZE AND SAVINGS WERE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT DEMAND, WHILE INTEREST RATES CHARGED, THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS OF RESPONDENTS, THE AMOUNT OF LOAN DEMANDED AND THE PROPORTION OF PREVIOUS LOANS REPAID WERE THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT SUPPLY. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, FORMAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS SHOULD TARGET YOUNGER FARMERS, INCLUDING WOMEN, USE GROUP AND SOCIAL ASSETS AS COLLATERAL RATHER THAN PHYSICAL ASSETS, CHARGE COMMERCIAL INTEREST RATES, MOBILIZE SAVINGS THROUGH THEIR RURAL OUTPOSTS AND GIVE MEDIUM-TERM RATHER THAN SHORT-TERM LOANS.","[OLUWASOLA, O.; ALIMI, T.] OBAFEMI AWOLOWO UNIV, DEPT AGR ECON, FAC AGR, IFE, OSUN STATE, NIGERIA.","OLUWASOLA, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), OBAFEMI AWOLOWO UNIV, DEPT AGR ECON, FAC AGR, IFE, OSUN STATE, NIGERIA.","OLUWEMIMO_OLUWASOLA@YAHOO.COM; WETWASOLA@OAUIFE.EDU.NG",NA,NA,"AIGBOKHAN BE, 2000, 22 DPC; AKANJI B, 1999, AGR FINANCE ISSUES N, P63; AYANWALE AB, 2003, J SOCIAL SCI, V42, P1; BINSWANGER H.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE MULTINOMIAL LOGIT (MNL) REGRESSION MODEL AND THE RANDOM FOREST (RF) TECHNIQUE ARE EMPLOYED FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES. TO AVOID HETEROSKEDASTICITY, THE ROBUST COVARIANCE MATRIX IS COMPUTED TO ESTIMATE THE SANDWICH ESTIMATOR WHICH IN TURN PROVIDES AN ASYMPTOTIC COVARIANCE MATRIX FOR BIASED ESTIMATORS. ADDITIONALLY, MULTICOLLINEARITY IS TESTED AMONG INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH VARIANCE INFLATION FACTORS LESS THAN 3. ADEQUACY APPROACH AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ARE USED TO DETERMINE RELEVANT LEVELS OF PREDICTORS. FOR MODELS COMPARISON, STATISTICAL EVALUATION METRICS INCLUDING COHEN'S KAPPA, MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR, ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR AND RELATIVE ABSOLUTE ERROR ARE EMPLOYED. FINDINGS THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND ADEQUACY APPROACH REVEALED THAT MNL IS MORE COMPATIBLE FOR EXPLAINING DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT PARTICIPATION. DUE TO INSIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE EVALUATION METRICS BETWEEN MODELS, THE WINNER OF CHOICE IS UNDETERMINED. AMONG OTHER DETERMINANTS, COLLATERAL, FARMSIZE, INCOME, PROCEDURE, LITERACY AND ALL RISK VARIABLES STAND OUT TO BE CRITICAL FACTORS WHEN DECIDING BORROWING SCHEMES. WHILE FINANCIALLY LITERATE FARMERS TEND TO ACQUIRE LOANS FROM BOTH SOURCES, BORROWING DECISIONS AGAINST DIFFERENT RISK SOURCES DEPEND ON RISK TYPE AND FAMERS' OWN DESIRE TO BORROW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE RESULTS OF THE MNL MODEL ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURES, WHICH REINFORCE THE ROLE OF COLLATERAL IN THE LOCAL CREDIT SCHEME. BESIDES, FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FARMERS' PERCEPTION ON DIFFERENT RISK SOURCES ALSO INFLUENCE HOW FARMERS' BORROWING STRATEGIES VARY AMONG SOURCES.","[HUY DUC DANG] NONG LAM UNIV, ECON FAC, HO CHI MINH, VIETNAM.; [AU HAI THI DAM; THUYEN THI PHAM; TRA MY THI NGUYEN] NONG LAM UNIV, HO CHI MINH, VIETNAM.","DANG, HD (REPRINT AUTHOR), NONG LAM UNIV, ECON FAC, HO CHI MINH, VIETNAM.","DDHUY@HCMUAF.EDU.VN",NA,NA,"ABDALLAH AH, 2016, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V76, P494, DOI 10.1108/AFR-05-2016-0052; AKHTAR S, 2019, J INTEGR AGR, V18, P460, DOI [10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61968-9, 10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61968-9]; ALLEN F, 2019, J FINANC INTERMED, V39, P19, DOI 10.1016/J.JFI.2018.06.004; AMIT Y, 1997, NEURAL COMPUT, V9, P1545, DOI 10.1162/NECO.1997.9.7.1545; ASANTE-ADDO C, 2017, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V77, P239, DOI 10.1108/AFR-02-2016-0010; ASSEFA TT, 2017, NJAS-WAGEN J LIFE SC, V80, P15, DOI 10.1016/J.NJAS.2016.11.002; BARSLUND M, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P485, DOI 10.1080/00220380801980798; BELGIU M, 2016, ISPRS J PHOTOGRAMM, V114, P24, DOI 10.1016/J.ISPRSJPRS.2016.01.011; BREIMAN L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1010933404324; CHALUMURI R.S., 2016, INT J TRAFFIC TRANSP, V6, P356, DOI [10.7708/IJTTE.2016.6(3).10, DOI 10.7708/IJTTE.2016.6(3).10]; CHAUKE P.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A TOTAL OF 835 HOUSEHOLDS AND 45 MICROFINANCE BANKS WERE UTILIZED AS THE SAMPLES OF THE STUDY WHICH WERE SELECTED USING MULTI-STAGE STRATIFIED SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. MULTINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE CREDIT RATIONING AMONG THE RURAL FARMERS IN NIGERIA. FINDINGS THE RESULT OF THE DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL SHOWS THAT FARMERS WHO ARE EITHER BEING ENGAGED IN SUBSISTENCE FARMING OR TRADING HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CREDIT RATIONING WITH THE GREATEST IMPACTS FOUND ON THE FARM PROFIT AND FARMERS' LOCATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE CONSISTENT WITH RISK-BALANCING THEORY, THE GOOD STORY FOR FARMERS IS THAT PROFIT MAKING FARMERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE AMONG THE CONSTRAINED BORROWERS. IT TURNED OUT FROM THE CREDIT RATIONING MODEL THAT URBAN FARMERS HAD A GREATER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS IN THE NIGERIAN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT MARKET. IN COMPARISON TO FARMERS AT PERIPHERY, URBAN RESIDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING CONSTRAINED BORROWERS.","[KOFARMATA, YUSUF IBRAHIM] YUSUF MAITAMA SULE UNIV KANO, FAC SOCIAL & MANAGEMENT SCI, DEPT ECON, KANO, NIGERIA.; [DANLAMI, ABUBAKAR HAMID] BAYERO UNIV, FAC SOCIAL SCI, DEPT ECON, KANO, NIGERIA.","DANLAMI, AH (REPRINT AUTHOR), BAYERO UNIV, FAC SOCIAL SCI, DEPT ECON, KANO, NIGERIA.","YUSUFKOFARMATA@GMAIL.COM; SADIQDANLAMI2@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"ADESINA A., 2013, THIS DAY NEWS P 0813; AKRAM W., 2012, INT J ACAD RES EC MA, V1, P36; AKUDUGU M.A., 2013, RES J FINANCE ACCOUN, V4, P1; [ANONYMOUS], 2013, NATION; [ANONYMOUS], 2013, THE CITIZEN; [ANONYMOUS], 2013, CBN IN 37 NEWL LIC M; ANTHONY E, 2010, BUSINESS EC J, V14, P1; BABATUNDE J., 2012, GHANA BUSINESS 1211; BAKHSHOODEH M., 2008, INT C APPL EC, P67; BARHAM BL, 1996, WORLD DEV, V24, P793, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(96)00001-0; BAYDAS MM, 1994, WORLD DEV, V22, P1073, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(94)90149-X; BOUCHER SR, 2008, AM J AGR ECON, V90, P409, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8276.2007.01116.X; BOUCHER SR, 2009, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V57, P609, DOI 10.1086/598763; BRATKOWSKI A, 2000, ECON TRANSIT, V8, P101, DOI 10.1111/1468-0351.00037; DANLAMI A.H., 2018, KASETSART J SOCIAL S, V2018, P422; DANLAMI A.H., 2014, NIGERIAN J MANAGEMEN, V5, P1; DANLAMI A.H., 2017, HYPERION EC J, V5, P16; DANLAMI AH, 2019, AGR RES, V8, P392, DOI 10.1007/S40003-018-0373-Z; DANLAMI AH, 2018, INT J ENERGY SECT MA, V12, P265, DOI 10.1108/IJESM-05-2016-0007; DANLAMI AH, 2018, ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN, V20, P1085, DOI 10.1007/S10668-017-9927-7; DANLAMI AH, 2017, BIOFUELS-UK, V8, P323, DOI 10.1080/17597269.2016.1226724; DANLAMI AH, 2016, INT J SOC ECON, V43, P1400, DOI 10.1108/IJSE-04-2015-0086; DIAGNE A., 1999, 67 FCND DP INT FOOD; DIAGNE A., 2001, 116 INT FOOD POL RES; DIAGNE A., 2000, 90 FCND DP INT FOOD; DILLMAN D.A., 2000, MAIL INTERNET SURVEY; DOAN T., 2010, 27509 MPRA, P1; FOLTZ JD, 2004, AGR ECON, V30, P229, DOI [10.1016/J.AGECON.2002.12.003, 10.1111/J.1574-0862.2004.TB00191.X]; FREEL M, 2012, SMALL BUS ECON, V38, P399, DOI 10.1007/S11187-010-9283-6; GODQUIN M., 2005, MAISON SCI EC BOULEV, V2005, P1; GUIRKINGER C, 2008, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V39, P295, DOI 10.1111/J.1574-0862.2008.00334.X; HARTARSKA V., 2012, J AGR APPL EC, V334, P1; HASH I., 2010, EC BUSINESS REV, V12, P29; IDRISA YL, 2008, J TROPICAL AGR FOOD, V7, P199; INYANG S., 2013, DAILY TRUST, V287; JAFFEE D., 1990, HDB MONETARY EC, V2, P837, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1573-4498(05)80023-2; JAPPELLI T, 1990, Q J ECON, V105, P219, DOI 10.2307/2937826; JIA XP, 2010, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V70, P37, DOI 10.1108/00021461011042620; KIMUTAI C.

FOR THE FULL SAMPLE, WE FIND THAT BEING A MAN, MORE EDUCATED, RICHER, EMPLOYED, AND OLDER TO A CERTAIN AGE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCESS TO FORMAL FINANCIAL SERVICES. FOR THE THREE COUNTRY SUB-GROUPS, THE IMPACTS OF EDUCATION AND INCOME ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF SAVING AND BORROWING FORMALLY ARE HIGHEST IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AND LOWEST IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES BUT THE RANKING IS REVERTED FOR FORMAL ACCOUNT AND PAYMENT. HOWEVER, THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPACTS INCREASES WITH THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND INCOME IN EACH OF COUNTRY SUB-GROUPS FOR ALL MEASURES FORMAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION.

THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES THE DETERMINANTS OF THE DECISION TO BORROW AND OF THE AMOUNT THAT IS BORROWED BY USING THE DOUBLE HURDLE MODEL AND HECKMAN SELECTION MODEL.

TODAY, MFIS FACE STRONG AND GROWING PRESSURE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY DUE TO AN INCREASING DEMAND FOR FUNDING, BOTH IN NUMBER AND VOLUMES. HOWEVER, THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON REFINANCING BETWEEN BANKS AND MFIS. ALSO, THE EXISTING EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON MICROFINANCE ACCESS TO EXTERNAL FUNDING HAS TO SOME EXTEND NEGLECTED THE IMPORTANCE OF BANK FINANCING FUNDS, FOCUSING MORE ON INTERNATIONAL EXTERNAL FUNDS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE ACCESS OF MFIS TO EXTERNAL FUNDS FROM THE LOCAL BANKING SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINE THE LINK BETWEEN AN MFI'S ACCESS TO BANKS FUNDING AND ITS MATURITY AND PERFORMANCE. FROM A PANEL OF 156 SENEGALESE MFIS, WE HAVE CREATED A FIXED-EFFECTS MODEL TO HELP EXPLAIN THE INFLUENCE OF KEY VARIABLES (MFI SIZE, PROFITABILITY, RISK, ETC.) ON AN MFI'S ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS FROM THE LOCAL BANKING SYSTEM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT BANK FINANCING GENERALLY BENEFIT LARGE MFIS, THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT TANGIBLE ASSETS AND WITH A HIGH QUALITY PORTFOLIO. PROFITABILITY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A KEY DETERMINANT OF MFI'S ACCESS TO BANK FUNDING. HOWEVER, THE FUNDS DEPOSITED BY MICROFINANCE ORGANIZATIONS IN BANKS ACT AS A FINANCING GUARANTEE AND STRONGLY HELP MFIS TO RAISE FUNDS FROM LOCAL COMMERCIAL BANKS.","[FALL, FRANCOIS SECK] UNIV TOULOUSE, LEREPS, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.; [FALL, FRANCOIS SECK] UNIV DAKAR, CRES, DAKAR, SENEGAL.","FALL, FS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TOULOUSE, LEREPS, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.; FALL, FS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV DAKAR, CRES, DAKAR, SENEGAL.","FRANCOIS-SECK.FALL@UT-CAPITOLE.FR",NA,NA,"BECK T, 2008, J FINANC ECON, V89, P467, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2007.10.005; BOOTH L, 2001, J FINANC, V56, P87, DOI 10.1111/0022-1082.00320; BRIERE M, 2015, WORLD DEV, V67, P110, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2014.10.007; CAPRIO G, 1993, WORLD DEV, V21, P523; D'ESPALLIER B, 2017, WORLD DEV, V89, P19, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2016.06.021; DORFLEITNER G., 2016, Q REV EC FINANCE, VXXX, PXXX; FALL F.

THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY ANALYSES FIRMS NOT ONLY FROM THE SMES POINT OF VIEW, BUT ALSO SHOWS RESULTS FOR MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES SEPARATELY. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ANALYSED THE DETERMINANTS OF ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES AT EACH COUNTRY LEVEL FOR AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF COUNTRY-LEVEL VARIATIONS IN SME FINANCING. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MICRO FIRMS AND FIRMS OWNED AND OPERATED BY WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF CREDITS FROM BANKS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FOUND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PLEDGE OF COLLATERAL AND ACCESS TO FINANCE. WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIUM FIRMS, WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT INNOVATIVE FIRMS HAVE A LARGER AMOUNT OF CREDIT FROM BANKS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE LOAN SIZE INCREASES AS THE INTEREST RATES INCREASE IN PARTICULAR FOR SMES ON THE WHOLE AND FOR MICRO-FIRMS, ALTHOUGH THE INTEREST RATE IS IN A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOAN SIZE IN CZECH REPUBLIC.","[RAHMAN, ASHIQUR; BELAS, JAROSLAV] TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN, DEPT ENTERPRISE ECON, MOSTNI 5139, ZLIN 76001, CZECH REPUBLIC.; [RAHMAN, M.

THE STUDY AIMS TO EXTEND THIS TO EXAMINE IF A PURE GENDER EFFECT EXISTS OR WHETHER IT IS THE INTERACTION OF GENDER WITH DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC AND PERCEPTUAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT PLAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PERCEPTION OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DATA WITHIN THIS STUDY ARE DRAWN FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) ADULT POPULATION SURVEY BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007. THE FIRST STAGE OF THE STUDY SPLITS MALE AND FEMALE RESPONDENTS INTO SEPARATE SUB-SAMPLES AND RUNS INDIVIDUAL REGRESSIONS ON EACH PORTION OF THE SAMPLE. THE SECOND STAGE OF THE STUDY COMBINES THE MALE AND FEMALE PORTIONS OF THE SAMPLE TO DIRECTLY EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES IN PERCEIVED FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT BETWEEN GENDERS. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A GREATER PROPORTION OF WOMEN ARE SOLELY CONSTRAINED BY FINANCIAL BARRIERS THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. THE GENDER OF THE RESPONDENT WAS ALSO FOUND TO INTERACT WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A SIGNIFICANT MANNER. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO MARKET THE AVAILABILITY OF START-UP FINANCE FROM VARIOUS SOURCES TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCE RATHER THAN BEING DISCOURAGED AT THE FIRST HURDLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - ALTHOUGH ACTUAL FINANCIAL BARRIERS FACED BY FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED, THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES TO FOCUS ON THE CONCEPT OF PERCEIVED FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS FACED BY POTENTIAL FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS.","[KWONG, CALEB] UNIV ESSEX, ENTREPRENEURSHIP & INNOVAT GRP, SOUTHEND ON SEA, ENGLAND.; [JONES-EVANS, DYLAN] UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF, ENTERPRISE & INNOVAT, CARDIFF, S GLAM, WALES.; [THOMPSON, PIERS] CARDIFF METROPOLITAN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING ECON & FINANCE, CARDIFF, WALES.","KWONG, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESSEX, ENTREPRENEURSHIP & INNOVAT GRP, SOUTHEND ON SEA, ENGLAND.","CKWONG@ESSEX.AC.UK",NA,NA,"AJZEN I, 1991, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V50, P179, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T; ALDRICH H.

THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EXAMINE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST SELF-EMPLOYED IMMIGRANTS IN THE CREDIT MARKET OF A DEVELOPED ECONOMY OUTSIDE THE US. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS CONSIDER ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL A MORE SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO THEIR SELF-EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES THAN DO NATIVE SWEDES AND EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS. SELF-EMPLOYED NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS REPORT MORE DISCRIMINATION BY BANKS, SUPPLIERS, AND CUSTOMERS THAN DO NATIVES AND IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IMMIGRANT-OWNED FIRMS APPLY FOR BANK LOANS TO A LARGER EXTENT THAN DO FIRMS OWNED BY NATIVES. NON-EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NATIVES TO HAVE A LOAN DENIED, AND THEY ARE ALSO CHARGED HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THEIR BANK LOANS THAN NATIVES. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT ROBUSTNESS CHECKS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION IN THE MARKET FOR BANK LOANS IS PUT FORWARD AS AN EXPLANATION FOR THESE RESULTS. LIMITED OR LACK OF ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO SELF-EMPLOYMENT AMONG CERTAIN IMMIGRANT GROUPS. THIS OBSTACLE MAY BE ONE EXPLANATION FOR THE HIGH EXIT RATES FROM SELF-EMPLOYMENT AMONG IMMIGRANTS, A FINDING THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES INCLUDING SWEDEN.","[ALDEN, LINA; HAMMARSTEDT, MATS] LINNAEUS UNIV, CTR LABOUR MARKET & DISCRIMINAT STUDIES, SE-35195 VAXJO, SWEDEN.","ALDEN, L; HAMMARSTEDT, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), LINNAEUS UNIV, CTR LABOUR MARKET & DISCRIMINAT STUDIES, SE-35195 VAXJO, SWEDEN.","LINA.ALDEN@LNU.SE; MATS.HAMMARSTEDT@LNU.SE","JAN WALLANDER AND TOM HEDELIUS FOUNDATION","ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR LINA ALDEN, CENTRE FOR LABOUR MARKET AND DISCRIMINATION STUDIES, LINNAEUS UNIVERSITY, SE-351 95 VAXJO, SWEDEN, LINA.ALDEN@LNU.SE.

THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN CREDIT AVAILABILITY IS LIKELY CAUSED BY DISCRIMINATION.","DARTMOUTH COLL, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.; NBER, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.; WELLESLEY COLL, WELLESLEY, MA 02181 USA.","BLANCHFLOWER, DG (REPRINT AUTHOR), DARTMOUTH COLL, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",NA,NA,NA,"BLANCHFLOWER DG, 1988, 6840 NAT BUR EC RES; BROWNE LE, 1995, NEW ENGL ECON REV, P53; CAVALLUZZO K, 1999, UNPUB COMPETITION SM; CAVALLUZZO KS, 1998, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V30, P771, DOI 10.2307/2601128; DAY TE, 1998, ECON INQ, V36, P3, DOI 10.1111/J.1465-7295.1998.TB01692.X; HARRISON GW, 1998, ECON INQ, V36, P29, DOI 10.1111/J.1465-7295.1998.TB01693.X; HORNE D.

THE RATIONALE HAS BEEN THAT SUCH BUSINESSES SHARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH TYPES OF OWNERS AND WOULD CONFOUND ANY GENDER-BASED DIFFERENCES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN WHICH THE CREDIT ACCESS EXPERIENCES OF EQUALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE COMPARED TO THOSE OF THEIR FEMALE- AND MALE-OWNED ENTREPRENEURIAL COUNTERPARTS. VARIOUS MEASURES OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ARE INTRODUCED THAT SUGGEST THAT EQUALLY OWNED BUSINESSES OFTEN DO EXPERIENCE LARGER CONSTRAINTS THAN MALE-OWNED BUSINESSES AND SMALLER CONSTRAINTS THAN FEMALE-OWNED BUSINESSES, WHEN ALL CREDIT APPLICANTS ARE CONSIDERED. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS ARE MORE MIXED IN COMPARISONS OF SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS' CONSTRAINTS. A DIFFERENT APPROACH FROM THAT OF EXISTING RESEARCH IS THEN USED TO STUDY EXACTLY HOW EQUALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES' EXPERIENCES ARE UNIQUE, RATHER THAN MERELY WHETHER THEY DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS. THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE DETERMINING THE CREDIT APPLICATION OUTCOMES OF ALL THREE OWNERSHIP GROUPS. WHERE SIMILAR DETERMINANTS ARE FOUND, EQUALLY OWNED BUSINESSES ARE INFLUENCED IN A MANNER MORE SIMILAR TO MALE-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EQUALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES' CREDIT ACCESS EXPERIENCE IS NOT EQUALLY BALANCED BETWEEN THOSE OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS.","UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT SOCIAL SCI ECON, DEARBORN, MI 48128 USA.","KIM, GO (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MICHIGAN, DEPT SOCIAL SCI ECON, DEARBORN, MI 48128 USA.",NA,NA,NA,"APILADO V., 1992, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V30, P38; AVALLUZZO K, 2002, FINANCE EC DISCUSSIO, P1; BATES T, 1991, Q REV ECON BUS, V31, P64; BITLER MP, 2001, FINANCIAL RESERVE B, P183; BLANCHFLOWER DG, 1998, NBER WORKING PAPER W, V6840; BRUSH C.G., 1992, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V16, P5, DOI DOI 10.1177/104225879201600401; BUTTNER EH, 1988, J BUS VENTURING, V3, P249, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(88)90018-3; BUTTNER EH, 1989, J BUS VENTURING, V4, P249, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(89)90015-3; BUTTNER EH, 1992, J SMALL BUS MANAGE, V30, P58; CARTER S., 1998, ENTREP REGION DEV, V10, P225, DOI DOI 10.1080/08985629800000013; CAVALLUZZO KS, 2002, J BUS, V75, P641, DOI 10.1086/341638; CAVALLUZZO KS, 1998, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V30, P771, DOI 10.2307/2601128; CHOW CKW, 2000, J BUS VENTURING, V15, P363, DOI 10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00014-7; COKER J.

HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE MAINLY ASSUMED THAT CREDIT HAS A HOMOGENEOUS IMPACT ON RECIPIENTS. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY FURTHER EXAMINING THE IMPACTS OF CREDIT ON DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ACCESSED HOUSEHOLDS CATEGORIZED BY RELATIVE POVERTY, LOAN VOLUMES, ACCESS TO AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICES AND ETHNICITY IN VIETNAM. THIS PAPER USES DATA OF 1338 HOUSEHOLDS COLLECTED FROM THE VIETNAM ACCESS RESOURCES HOUSEHOLD SURVEY IN 2012. TO INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF ESTIMATION MEASURES, THE DISTRIBUTION FOR THE IMPACT ESTIMATOR IS FURTHER CONSTRUCTED BY APPLYING THE BOOTSTRAPPING APPROACH TO THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING. RESULTS SHOW THAT CREDIT ACCESS AFFECTS RECIPIENT GROUPS HETEROGENEOUSLY. ALTHOUGH THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE IMPACTS ON NON-FARM INCOME, CREDIT HAS NO EFFECT ON FARM INCOME, EVEN FOR RECIPIENTS WITH MORE ANNUAL VISITS TO AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION. WHILE CREDIT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES TOTAL INCOME, PER CAPITA INCOME, AND NONFARM INCOME OF THE KINH MAJORITY, IT HAS LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ON THOSE INCOME COMPONENTS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE STUDY IS CONDUCTED IN ASSAM, INDIA AND USES A QUASI-EXPERIMENT DESIGN TO GATHER PRIMARY DATA. ECONOMETRIC TOOLS LIKE HECKIT PROCEDURE, TOBIT SELECTION EQUATION AND PROBIT MODEL ARE USED FOR EMPIRICAL PURPOSE. FINDINGS THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL WELFARE IS INFLUENCED BY EQUIVALENT FACTORS. IN ADDITION, THE STUDY OBSERVES A LARGER INCIDENCE OF POVERTY AMONG TREATMENT HOUSEHOLDS OF SEMIFORMAL AND INFORMAL BORROWERS. THE STUDY ARGUES THAT FORMAL SOURCES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS BY LIFTING THOSE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE POVERTY LINE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE STUDY INDICATES A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF INCOME AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY AMONG SEMIFORMAL AND INFORMAL BORROWERS. BY TRADITION, AS RURAL ASSAM GETS A DOMINANT ROLE OF TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY-BASED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE SHOULD DEVELOP THE BANKING STRUCTURE BY INVOLVING THESE INSTITUTIONS. THE STUDY EXCLUDES OTHER PROBABLE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES WHILE EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF CREDIT ACCESS ON INCOME AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY, AND THIS LIMITATION IS LEFT TO FUTURE RESEARCH.

WE FIND THAT THE REFORM HAD DIFFERENTIAL CREDIT EFFECTS ACROSS HOUSEHOLDS. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH ABOVE-AVERAGE ECONOMIC STATUS (MEASURED BY THE AREA OF CULTIVATED LAND, LEVEL OF INCOME, AND CONVENIENCE OF BANK VISITS), ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF THE REFORM. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH BELOW-AVERAGE ECONOMICS STATUS, RELIANCE ON INFORMAL CREDIT LESSENED. WE SHOW THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF LAND AS COLLATERAL MIGHT HAVE ENHANCED ACCESS TO FORMAL CREDIT. ANOTHER CHANNEL OF THE CREDIT EFFECTS WAS INCOME AND WEALTH. WE FIND THAT LAND TITLING HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THEIR NEED FOR INFORMAL CREDIT. FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH ABOVE-AVERAGE AREA OF CULTIVATED LAND, LAND TITLING INCREASED THEIR WEALTH AND MIGHT HAVE EXPANDED THEIR OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE BOTH THEIR CREDIT DEMAND AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS FORMAL CREDIT.","[ZHANG, LONGYAO] NANJING AGR UNIV, COLL FINANCE, 1 WEIGANG, NANJING 210095, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [CHENG, WENLI] MONASH UNIV, MONASH BUSINESS SCH, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; [CHENG, ENJIANG] VICTORIA UNIV, VICTORIA INST STRATEG ECON STUDIES, MELBOURNE, VIC, AUSTRALIA.; [WU, BI] MINIST AGR & RURAL AFFAIRS, RES CTR RURAL ECON, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.","ZHANG, LY (REPRINT AUTHOR), NANJING AGR UNIV, COLL FINANCE, 1 WEIGANG, NANJING 210095, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.","ZHANGLY@NJAU.EDU.CN","NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71773049]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71573125]; THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71773049].","ACEMOGLU D, 2001, AM ECON REV, V91, P1369, DOI 10.1257/AER.91.5.1369; ALI DA, 2014, J DEV ECON, V110, P262, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2013.12.009; BESLEY TJ, 2012, Q J ECON, V127, P237, DOI 10.1093/QJE/QJR056; BOUCHER SR, 2005, WORLD DEV, V33, P107, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2004.09.004; BOUCHER SR, 2008, AM J AGR ECON, V90, P409, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8276.2007.01116.X; BOUCHER SR, 2009, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V57, P609, DOI 10.1086/598763; CARTER MR, 2003, AM J AGR ECON, V85, P173, DOI 10.1111/1467-8276.00111; CHENG EJ, 2014, CHINA AGR ECON REV, V6, P295, DOI 10.1108/CAER-07-2012-0076; DE SOTO HERNANDO, 2000, MYSTERY CAPITAL WHY; DEININGER K, 2006, EUR ECON REV, V50, P1245, DOI 10.1016/J.EUROECOREV.2005.02.001; DEININGER K, 2014, WORLD DEV, V59, P505, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2013.10.009; DEININGER K, 2012, J DEV ECON, V99, P236, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2012.02.007; DEININGER K, 2009, WORLD BANK RES OBSER, V24, P233, DOI 10.1093/WBRO/LKP007; DEMSETZ H, 1967, AM ECON REV, V57, P347; DO QT, 2008, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V56, P531, DOI 10.1086/533549; DONALDSON JOHN A., 2015, CONT CHINESE POLITIC, V1, P51; DOWER PC, 2014, B INDONES ECON STUD, V50, P435, DOI 10.1080/00074918.2014.980376; EFENDIC A, 2011, EUR J POLIT ECON, V27, P586, DOI 10.1016/J.EJPOLECO.2010.12.003; FEDER G, 1998, LAND USE POLICY, V15, P25, DOI 10.1016/S0264-8377(97)00039-2; FEDER G, 1987, AM J AGR ECON, V69, P311, DOI 10.2307/1242281; GALIANI S, 2010, J PUBLIC ECON, V94, P700, DOI 10.1016/J.JPUBECO.2010.06.002; LAWRY S, 2017, J DEV EFFECT, V9, P61, DOI 10.1080/19439342.2016.1160947; NORTH D.C., 1973, RISE W WORLD NEW EC; PIZA C, 2016, J DEV EFFECT, V8, P129, DOI 10.1080/19439342.2015.1057859; PLACE F, 1998, LAND ECON, V74, P360, DOI 10.2307/3147118; VENDRYES T, 2014, J ECON SURV, V28, P971, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6419.2012.00743.X; WANG H, 2015, CHINA ECON REV, V36, P220, DOI 10.1016/J.CHIECO.2015.09.005","27",1,"1","7","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0003-6846","1466-4283","APPL ECON","APPL.

PERSONAL CONNECTIONS (RELATIONSHIP) ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINATE OF THE SUPPLY FOR CREDIT.","[RUI, LI] BEIJING UNIV AERONAUT & ASTRONAUT, SCH ECON & MANAGEMENT, BEIJING 100083, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [XI, ZHU] SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, ANTAI COLL ECON & MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI 200052, PEOPLES R CHINA.","RUI, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), BEIJING UNIV AERONAUT & ASTRONAUT, SCH ECON & MANAGEMENT, XUEYUAN RD 37, BEIJING 100083, PEOPLES R CHINA.","LIRUI@BUAA.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"ABADIE A, 2006, ECONOMETRICA, V74, P235, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-0262.2006.00655.X; ANGRIST JD, 1996, J AM STAT ASSOC, V91, P444, DOI 10.2307/2291629; CARTER MR, 1998, J DEV STUD, V28, P83; CRISTINA D, 1980, BORROWERS LENDERS RU; DUTTA D, 2006, APPL ECON, V38, P1627, DOI 10.1080/00036840500427148; FEDER G, 1990, AM J AGR ECON, V72, P1151, DOI 10.2307/1242524; FOLTZ JD, 2004, AGR ECON, V30, P229, DOI [10.1016/J.AGECON.2002.12.003, 10.1111/J.1574-0862.2004.TB00191.X]; HECKMAN JJ, 1998, REV ECON STUD, V65, P261, DOI 10.1111/1467-937X.00044; HECKMAN JJ, 1992, EVALUATING WELFARE AND TRAINING PROGRAMS, P201; IMBENS GW, 1994, ECONOMETRICA, V62, P467, DOI 10.2307/2951620; KOCHAR A, 1997, J DEV ECON, V53, P339, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(97)00020-5; KRANDKER SR, 2003, AGR EC, V28, P197; MANRIQUE J, 2004, APPL ECON, V36, P781, DOI 10.1080/0003684042000229514; MENG CL, 1985, INT ECON REV, V26, P71, DOI 10.2307/2526528; MILDE H, 1988, Q J ECON, V103, P101, DOI 10.2307/1882644; MYERS RH, 2000, RURAL FINANCIAL MARK, P5; POIRIER DJ, 1980, J ECONOMETRICS, V12, P209, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(80)90007-X; ROSENBAUM PR, 1983, BIOMETRIKA, V70, P41, DOI 10.1093/BIOMET/70.1.41; RUBIN DB, 1974, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V66, P688, DOI 10.1037/H0037350; STIGLITZ JE, 1981, AM ECON REV, V71, P393; WOOLDRIDGE J.

THE SURVEY SHOWS THAT BANK LOANS ARE THE MAIN WAY OF FINANCING FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISES, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISES TO OBTAIN LONG-TERM LOANS. IT CAN BE SEEN THAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISES ARE FACING STRONG CREDIT FINANCING CONSTRAINTS. WE FOUND THAT IN THE PROCESS OF ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION, POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ARE BENEFICIAL TO REDUCE THE COST OF FINANCIAL BORROWING. THROUGH CHARITABLE DONATION, ENTERPRISES CAN HAVE STRONGER STRATEGIC CONDITIONS, THUS OPTIMIZING THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF ENTERPRISES AND REDUCING FINANCIAL COST CONSTRAINTS. THIS KIND OF ASSOCIATION BEHAVIOR ALSO HAS HUGE ECONOMIC EFFECTS, EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOWTHAT CHARITABLE MOTIVATION HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON CORPORATE CREDIT DEMAND SATISFACTION, LOAN MATURITY AND LOAN COST.

THE DYNAMIC CONCEPT OF THE ""ENTREPRENEURIAL CREDIT JOURNEY"" IS DEVELOPED TO FRAME THE DISCUSSION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDE ISSUES AFFECTING ENTREPRENEURIAL BORROWING. THE ENTREPRENEURIAL CREDIT JOURNEY FOLLOWS THE ENTREPRENEUR FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREDIT NEEDS, THROUGH APPLICATION AND LENDING DECISIONS AND, BEYOND, TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE EARLIER DECISIONS FOR FIRM PERFORMANCE. THE LITERATURE HAS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSSED ON THE LENDING DECISION STAGE, INCLUDING: PROBLEMS OF CREDIT RATIONING WHICH MAY ARISE DUE TO ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; AND LENDING TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE INFORMATION ISSUES. HOWEVER, ON THE DEMAND SIDE, DISCOURAGED BORROWERS, WHO DECIDE NOT TO APPLY FOR FEAR OF REJECTION, HAVE RECEIVED INCREASING ATTENTION. THERE IS ALSO GREATER ATTENTION TO ISSUES OF ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITION (E.G., OVER-OPTIMISM, ILLUSION OF CONTROL) WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT BORROWING DECISIONS. IN TERMS OF THE FIRM PERFORMANCE EFFECTS OF CREDIT ACCESS, THE REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE WIDELY USED INTERNAL FINANCE APPROACH TO TESTING FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IS UNIDENTIFIED BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO DISENTANGLE FINANCIAL FROM COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS. AN ALTERNATIVE, MORE DIRECT, EXTERNAL FUNDING GAPS TEST OF UNDER-INVESTMENT IS THEREFORE PROPOSED. THE POLICY LITERATURE IS ALSO REVIEWED WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF LOAN GUARANTEES HAS BEEN BOTH FINANCE AND ECONOMIC ADDITIONAL I.E., PROVIDING ENTREPRENEURS WITH CREDIT THEY CANNOT GET ELSEWHERE AND HELPING TO CREATE JOBS THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN CREATED) ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS. A DISCUSSION OF THE LITERATURE RELATING TO UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL CREDIT MARKET HIGHLIGHTS THAT FEMALE AND ETHNIC MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS MAY RECEIVE LESS CREDIT, AND/OR PAY A HIGHER RATE ON THE CREDIT THEY RECEIVE, THAN THEIR MALE OR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THIS SPEAKS TO ONGOING ISSUES OF GENDER STEREOTYPES AND ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION IN THE CREDIT MARKET. THE INCREASING ROLE OF PEER-TO-PEER LENDING FOLLOWING THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR 'DEMOCRATIZING ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE', IS DISCUSSED. THIS LITERATURE HIGHLIGHTS THAT, WHILE PEER-TO-PEER LENDING IS HELPING TO FILL CREDIT GAPS FOLLOWING THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS, THERE ARE ISSUES RELATING TO THE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL BUSINESS PEER-TO-PEER LOANS AND POSSIBLE ISSUES OF ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION.

WE INTERPRET, THESE RESULTS IN TERMS OF INFORMATION AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT WORK WITHIN ETHNIC GROUPS BUT NOT ACROSS THEM. (C) 2002 ELSEVIER SCIENCE B.V.

HOWEVER, CONSTRUCTION SMES ARE FACED WITH DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESSING CREDIT FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FURTHERMORE, PAST RESEARCH HAS FAILED TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT PREDICT CREDIT ACCESSIBILITY FOR CONSTRUCTION SMES IN SOUTH AFRICA. THIS STUDY DETERMINES THE PREDICTING DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS FOR CREDIT ACCESSIBILITY FOR CONSTRUCTION SMES FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA. A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH WAS USED AND DATA WAS COLLECTED, USING A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY FROM 250 CONSTRUCTION SMES WHO WERE CONVENIENTLY SAMPLED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND COMPANY PROFILE FACTORS PREDICTING CREDIT ACCESSIBILITY WERE MODELLED AND SET AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WITH CREDIT ACCESSIBILITY TO THE CONSTRUCTION SMES AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AMOUNT OBTAINED FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE DATA WAS ANALYSED USING THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS) VERSION 22. BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE PREDICTORS OF OBTAINING CREDIT. IN THE FIRST MODEL, THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE CREDIT ACCESSED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AMOUNT AND THOSE WHO DID NOT RECEIVE CREDIT AT ALL, WHEN MODELLED WITH THE CONCEPTUALISED PREDICTORS SUGGESTED, SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF OBTAINING CREDIT. HOWEVER, IN THE SECOND MODEL, WHEN THE CONCEPTUALISED PREDICTORS WERE MODELLED WITH FULL AND PARTIAL CREDIT, THE RESULTS ESTABLISHED THAT AGE GROUP, CURRENT POSITION IN THE ORGANISATION, TAX NUMBER AND LOCATION WERE GOOD PREDICTORS OF OBTAINING FULL CREDIT. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CANNOT BE GENERALISED ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA, AS THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE GAUTENG PROVINCE. THE VALUE OF THIS STUDY INFORMS OWNERS OF SMES IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE THEIR AGE AND CURRENT POSITION IN THE ORGANISATION WHEN APPLYING FOR CREDIT. THEY SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE TAX NUMBER AND THE LOCATION OF THE BUSINESS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF OBTAINING FULL CREDIT FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.","[BALOGUN, OLANREWAJU] UNIV JOHANNESBURG, DEPT CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT & QUANT SURVEYING, CORNER SIEMERT & BEIT ST, ZA-2028 JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.; [AGUMBA, JUSTUS] DURBAN UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT & QUANT SURVEYING, CORNER BOT RD & STEVE BIKO RD,BLOCK S3 LEVEL 2, DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA.; [ANSARY, NAZEEM] TSHWANE UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT BLDG SCI, PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.","BALOGUN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV JOHANNESBURG, DEPT CONSTRUCT MANAGEMENT & QUANT SURVEYING, CORNER SIEMERT & BEIT ST, ZA-2028 JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.","LBALOGUN@UJ.AC.ZA; JUSTUSA@DUT.AC.ZA; ANSARYN@TUT.AC.ZA",NA,NA,"ABDULSALEH AM, 2013, INT J BUSINESS MANAG, V8, P36, DOI DOI 10.5539/IJBM.V8N14P36; ADUDA J., 2012, INT J HUMANIT SOC SC, V2, P203; AGUMBA J.

TO FIND THE IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING ACCESS TO CREDIT IN SINDH PROVINCE OF PAKISTAN, WE PERFORMED DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND PROBIT REGRESSION MODEL. THE RESULTS OF PROBIT REGRESSION MODEL SHOWED THAT GENDER, HOUSEHOLD SIZE, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, FARMING EXPERIENCE, FARM SIZE, INCOME, AND AVAILABILITY OF COLLATERAL HAVE POSITIVE EFFECT ON FARMERS' ACCESS TO CREDIT, WHILE AGE HAS A NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FARMERS' ACCESS TO CREDIT.

THEY ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN AN ISLAMIC ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY RISK-SHARING VALUES AND WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION AS INCENTIVES TO FINANCIAL CONTRACTING. FAMILY TIES ARE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF FIRMS' FINANCING CONSTRAINTS UNDER ALTERNATIVE MODELS.

CONSIDERING THE FACT, THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO ANALYSES THE CREDIT CONSTRAINTS EXPERIENCED BY FEMALE BORROWERS IN THE CONTEXT OF VISEGRAD COUNTRIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE WANTED TO SHED LIGHT WHETHER GENDER DISCRIMINATION PHENOMENON IN SME LOAN MARKET IS ALSO RELEVANT IN THESE COUNTRIES OR NOT. TO UNDERSTAND FINANCING DIFFICULTIES FOR FEMALE-BASED FIRMS, THIS PAPER UTILIZES THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE BEEPS (BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE SURVEY) SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE EBRD (EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT) DURING THE PERIOD 2012-2014. BY USING A SAMPLE OF 1296 SMES IN THESE FOUR COUNTRIES, WE FOUND THAT THE SMES OWNED BY THE FEMALE BORROWERS ARE NOT BEING DISCRIMINATED BY BANKS OR EXTERNAL LENDERS. WE FOUND THAT BOTH MALE AND FEMALE BORROWERS HAVE A SIMILAR PERCEPTION OF FINANCING DIFFICULTIES AND GETTING A SIMILAR LEVEL OF PRIORITY WHILE ASKING FOR BANK LOANS. HENCE, IT SHOWS THAT GENDER DISCRIMINATION IS NOT A CASE IN THE VISEGRAD COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT BORROWERS EXPERIENCE CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON GETTING BANK LOANS, THAT MEANS BORROWERS WITH HIGHER EXPERIENCE CAN FACILITATE IN GETTING EXTERNAL LOANS. WE ALSO SHOW THAT FIRMS WITH AN AUDIT REPORT HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO EXTERNAL LOANS THAN FIRMS WITHOUT AN AUDIT REPORT. WE DID NOT FIND ANY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT INNOVATIVE FIRMS ARE FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINTS THAN THE NON-INNOVATIVE ONES.","[RAHMAN, A.; ZBRANKOVA, H.] TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN, FAC MANAGEMENT & ECON, ZLIN, CZECH REPUBLIC.","RAHMAN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN, FAC MANAGEMENT & ECON, ZLIN, CZECH REPUBLIC.","RAHMAN@UTB.CZ; ZBRANKOVI@AMACO.CZ","INTERNAL GRANT AGENCY OF FAME TBU [IGA/FAME/2019/002]","ASHIQUR RAHMAN IS GRATEFUL TO THE INTERNAL GRANT AGENCY OF FAME TBU NO.

FEMALE-CFO-LED BORROWERS SEEM TO BE GRANTED MORE UNFAVORABLE LOAN TERMS THAN MALE-CFO-LED BORROWERS, SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT FEMALE CFOS EXPERIENCE CREDIT DISCRIMINATION. FURTHER ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT REGIONAL FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT HELPS TO ALLEVIATE LENDING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FEMALE CFOS. FURTHERMORE, FEMALE CFOS IN SOES ARE LESS LIKELY THAN THEIR NON-SOE COUNTERPARTS TO EXPERIENCE GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THE CREDIT MARKET. (C) 2015 SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY.

FINDINGS - THE DATA PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT ENTREPRENEURS WITH AN IMMIGRATION BACKGROUND (""ETHNIC ENTREPRENEURS""), DEFINED AS GERMAN RESIDENTS WHO HOLD FOREIGN CITIZENSHIP OR WHO WERE BORN OUTSIDE GERMANY, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE DENIED CREDIT OR TO BE AWARDED SMALLER LOANS THAN REQUESTED THAN ARE NATIVE ENTREPRENEURS. HOWEVER, THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THIS EFFECT MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN RISK FACTORS AND FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, RATHER THAN ETHNICITY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE DATASET CONSISTS OF 234 OBSERVATIONS. THE RESULTS REFER TO THE SAMPLE AND MIGHT NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF ETHNIC MINORITY START-UPS IN GENERAL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - APART FROM THE RISK FACTORS OBSERVED IN THE STUDY, COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS AND LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE SOURCES OF EXTERNAL FINANCING MAY BE RELEVANT. BETTER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ETHNIC MINORITY BUSINESSES MAY HELP TO REDUCE THE FINANCING GAP VIS-A-VIS NATIVE ENTREPRENEURS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS IS THE FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF ETHNIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN GERMANY USING UNIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO OBSERVATIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ETHNIC MINORITIES AND HAS NOT TESTED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO CREDIT.","[BRUDER, JANA; NEUBERGER, DORIS; RATHKE-DOPPNER, SOLVIG] UNIV ROSTOCK, ROSTOCK, GERMANY.","NEUBERGER, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ROSTOCK, ROSTOCK, GERMANY.","DORIS.NEUBERGER@UNI-ROSTOCK.DE",NA,NA,"ANDERLONI L, 2007, NEW FRONTIERS BANKIN, P5; BALLARD J., 2016, WORKING PAPER, DOI 10.24926/8668.0901; BARRETT G., 2002, INT J ENTREPRENEURIA, V8, P11, DOI DOI 10.1108/13552550210423697; BATES T, 1991, Q REV ECON BUS, V31, P64; BAYCAN-LEVENT T., 2007, 112007 VU U; BECKER G., 1957, EC DISCRIMINATION; BESANKO D, 1987, INT ECON REV, V28, P671, DOI 10.2307/2526573; BESTER H, 1985, AM ECON REV, V75, P850; BESTER H, 1987, EUR ECON REV, V31, P887, DOI 10.1016/0014-2921(87)90005-5; BESTER H, 1994, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V26, P72, DOI 10.2307/2078035; BLANCHFLOWER DG, 2003, REV ECON STAT, V85, P930, DOI 10.1162/003465303772815835; BOOT AWA, 2000, J FINANC INTERMED, V9, P7, DOI 10.1006/JFIN.2000.0282; BOSTIC R.

THEREFORE, FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION TO ALLEVIATE WELFARE INEQUALITY AND ENSURE INCOME CONVERGENCE, RURAL FINANCIAL MARKETS MUST BE REDESIGNED TO ALLOW WIDER ACCESS TO CREDIT, SPECIFICALLY FOR LOW-INCOME AND VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS.","[IBRAHIM, SAIFULLAHI SANI; OZDESER, HUSEYIN; CAVUSOGLU, BEHIYE] NEAR EAST UNIV, DEPT ECON, NICOSIA, TURKEY.","IBRAHIM, SS (REPRINT AUTHOR), NEAR EAST UNIV, DEPT ECON, NEAR EAST BLVD,MERSIN 10, TR-99138 NICOSIA TRNC, TURKEY.","SAIFULLAHIIBRAHIM.SANI@NEU.EDU.TR","TERTIARY EDUCATION TRUST FUND; ACADEMIC STAFF TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT FELLOWSHIP [TETFUND/IBR 165]","DATA COLLECTION WAS PARTLY SUPPORTED BY THE TERTIARY EDUCATION TRUST FUND AND THE ACADEMIC STAFF TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT FELLOWSHIP, AWARDED TO THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR THROUGH THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY DUTSIN-MA (FUDMA) INSTITUTIONAL GRANT [GRANT NUMBER TETFUND/IBR 165].","AGBIBOA D E, 2013, AFRICAN CONFLICT PEA, V3, P144, DOI DOI 10.2979/AFRICONFPEACREVI.3.1.144; ALIERO HM, 2012, STUDIES STATE NIGERI, P323; BANERJEE A, 2015, AM ECON J-APPL ECON, V7, P22, DOI 10.1257/APP.20130533; BAUMANN T, 2004, DEV SO AFR, V21, P785, DOI [10.1080/0376835042000325705, DOI 10.1080/0376835042000325705]; BECK T, 2004, FINANCE INEQUALITY P; BRANNEN C, 2016, DEV SO AFR, V33, P502, DOI 10.1080/0376835X.2016.1179097; CALIENDO M, 2008, J ECON SURV, V22, P31, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6419.2007.00527.X; CBN, 2017, 2016 ANN REP NAT FIN; CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN), 2012, NIG NAT FIN INCL STR; CHIBBA M, 2009, EUR J DEV RES, V21, P213, DOI 10.1057/EJDR.2008.17; CONROY J, 2005, ASIA PACIFIC DEV J, V12, P53, DOI DOI 10.18356/339EE7FC-EN; DANIELS REZA, 2004, DEV SO AFR, V21, P831, DOI DOI 10.1080/0376835042000325732; DEMIRGUC-KUNT A, 2008, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V4468; DIMOVA R, 2018, J DEV STUD, V54, P1534, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2017.1371293; DZANKU FM, 2015, J RURAL STUD, V40, P102, DOI 10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2015.06.009; ENHANCING FINANCIAL INNOVATION & ACCESS (EFINA), 2017, ACC FIN SERV NIG 201; FAFCHAMPS M, 2004, MARKET I SUBSAHARAN; GAUTAM Y, 2016, J RURAL STUD, V44, P239, DOI 10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2016.02.001; GIORDANO T, 2016, DEV SO AFR, V33, P562, DOI 10.1080/0376835X.2016.1179102; GURR TR, 2005, EC FACTORS CONTRIBUT; HASSAN R, 2011, DEV SO AFR, V28, P19, DOI 10.1080/0376835X.2011.545168; IBRAHIM SS, 2012, INT J EC FINANCIAL I, V2, P395; IBRAHIM SS, 2014, CONT ISSUES NIGERIAS, P257; JOHNSON S, 2011, J DEV STUD, V47, P475, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2010.492857; KIRSTEN M., 2012, ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT & MICROFINANCE, V23, P276, DOI 10.3362/1755-1986.2012.029; KRUMER-NEVO M, 2017, J SOC WORK, V17, P511, DOI 10.1177/1468017316649330; LEYSHON A, 1995, T I BRIT GEOGR, V20, P312, DOI 10.2307/622654; MACHADO JAF, 2005, J APPL ECONOM, V20, P445, DOI 10.1002/JAE.788; NURUDDEEN T, 2014, J EC SUSTAINABLE DEV, V5, P20; PAGURA M., 2006, SMALL ENTERPRISE DEV, V17, P16, DOI DOI 10.3362/0957-1329.2006.005; PARK C.Y., 2015, ASIAN DEV BANK EC WO, V20, P419, DOI [10.2139/SSRN.2558936, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.2558936]; RAY D, 1998, DEV EC; ROSENBAUM PR, 1983, BIOMETRIKA, V70, P41, DOI 10.1093/BIOMET/70.1.41; SINCLAIR S, 2013, INT J SOCIOL SOC POL, V33, P658, DOI 10.1108/IJSSP-09-2012-0080; UCHE C.

WE FIND THAT THE SOCIAL-BANKING POLICY HAS PLAYED CRUCIAL ROLE TO FOSTER FINANCIAL INCLUSION ACROSS STATES IN INDIA DURING 1977-1990.

THE PAPER USED SPSS (STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENTIST) AND APPLIED MEDGRAPH PROGRAM (EXCEL VERSION 13), SOBEL TEST, AND KENNY & BARON GUIDELINE TO TEST FOR THE MEDIATING ROLE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM A TOTAL SAMPLE OF 400 POOR HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN RURAL UGANDA WHO WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THIS STUDY. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT SOCIAL NETWORKS PARTIALLY MEDIATE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. BESIDES, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACTS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. THIS IMPLIES THAT SOME EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION GO THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS TO CAUSE AN IMPACT ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. THEREFORE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS BANKS AND MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD DEVELOP FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT PROMOTE SOCIAL NETWORKING AMONG POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL UGANDA. IN ADDITION, THEY SHOULD ADVOCATE FOR PARTICIPATION BY POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN EXISTING VILLAGE ASSOCIATIONS AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS SO AS TO DEVELOP WIDE SOCIAL NETWORKS.

HOWEVER, SUCCESS OF SUCH PROGRAMS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON RELAXING CREDIT ACCESS CONSTRAINTS FOR PRIMARY OCOP PRODUCERS TO BE ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR INVESTMENT. THIS PAPER APPLIES A LOGIT REGRESSION AND DATA COLLECTED FROM FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS WITH 482 FARM HOUSEHOLDS AND RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS IN NORTHWESTERN VIETNAM TO EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF CREDIT GAP BETWEEN CREDIT DEMAND AND SUPPLY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CREDIT ACCESS CONSTRAINTS ARE QUITE COMMON FOR CINNAMON AND BAMBOO FARM HOUSEHOLDS. THE AMOUNTS OF CREDIT PROVIDED SATISFIED ONLY PART OF HOUSEHOLDS' CREDIT DEMAND. LACK OF VALUABLE COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSES AND OTHER FIXED ASSETS IS THE MAIN FACTOR EXPLAINING THE SHORTAGE OF BANK CREDITS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPORTION OF FARM HOUSEHOLDS WITH BANK ACCOUNTS REMAINS TO BE LOW, WHILE CONVENIENT ACCESS TO BANK ACCOUNTS IMPROVES HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY AND FACILITATES ACCESS TO BANK CREDIT. REDESIGNING THE ""ONE SIZE FITS ALL"" BANK CREDIT POLICY IS NEEDED TO BE SUITABLE FOR DIFFERENT OCOP PROGRAMS. MOREOVER, PROMOTING MULTIPARTY COOPERATION BETWEEN BANKS AND OTHER ACTORS CAN BE A SUSTAINABLE DIRECTION IN CONNECTING AGRICULTURAL CREDIT SUPPLY AND DEMAND.","[DO XUAN LUAN] THAI NGUYEN UNIV AGR & FORESTRY, NGUYEN, VIETNAM.; [DIEP THANH TUNG] TRA VINH UNIV, TRA VINH, VIETNAM.","LUAN, DX (REPRINT AUTHOR), THAI NGUYEN UNIV AGR & FORESTRY, NGUYEN, VIETNAM.","DOXUANLUAN@TUAF.EDU.VN; DTTUNG@TVU.EDU.VN","VIETNAM NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (NAFOSTED)NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (NAFOSTED) [502.01-2016.12]","""THIS RESEARCH IS FUNDED BY VIETNAM NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT (NAFOSTED) UNDER GRANT NUMBER 502.01-2016.12"".

THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WORK IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR OR ON SMALL PIECES OF LAND AND ARE ENGAGED IN CARE WORK WITH LITTLE OR NO PAY. ALSO, WOMEN HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO CREDIT, LAND, AGRICULTURAL INPUTS, EQUIPMENT AND EXTENSION SERVICES, AS WELL AS MARKETS FOR THEIR PRODUCE THAN MEN. SOME OF THE INEQUITIES ARE EMBEDDED IN THE DEEP-ROOTED CULTURAL NORMS AND BELIEFS IN THE AFRICAN SOCIETIES. TO SOME EXTENT, THE INEQUALITIES CAN PARTLY BE ADDRESSED BY CHANGING OF POLICIES THAT REINFORCE GENDER INEQUALITIES AS WELL AS FORMULATING AND ENFORCING LAWS THAT PROMOTE WOMENS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT. THUS, MORE COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH WORK IS STILL REQUIRED TO HIGHLIGHT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH GENDER INEQUALITY AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MOVE TOWARDS REDUCING GENDER INEQUALITY. THE FOUR PAPERS IN THIS JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT EXPLORE THE ISSUE OF GENDER INEQUALITY AND LOOK AT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENDER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE FIRST PAPER BY SEGUINO AND WERE IS ON GENDER, DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT A SHIFT IN EMPHASIS OF CENTRAL BANK TARGETS TO EMPLOYMENT AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT CAN HELP REDUCE GENDER GAP. THE SECOND PAPER BY CHERYL DOSS FOCUSES ON COLLECTING GENDER DISAGGREGATED DATA TO IMPROVE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. ITS MAIN FINDING IS THAT CONSISTENT MEASURES OF GENDER ASSET AND WEALTH GAPS PROVIDE A MEANS OF TRACKING IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF POLICIES DESIGNED TO REDUCE POVERTY AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE THIRD PAPER IS ON GENDER AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT IN AFRICA: EVIDENCE AND POLICY BY NAOMI NETSAYI WEKWETE. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT INITIATIVES THAT IMPROVE WOMENS ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT SUCH AS SKILLS TRAINING AMONG OTHERS PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. FINALLY, THE FOURTH PAPER BY NANCY FOLBRE IS ON THE CARE ECONOMY IN AFRICA: SUBSISTENCE PRODUCTION AND UNPAID CARE. THE MAIN FINDING OF THE PAPER IS THAT ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT REDUCE THE CARE BURDEN ON WOMEN WITH INVESTMENTS THAT ENHANCE REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF UNPAID WORK AND POOL THE RISKS OF CARING FOR DEPENDENTS THROUGH SOCIAL INSURANCE WHICH PROMOTES ECONOMIC GROWTH BY IMPROVING THE CAPABILITIES OF BOTH WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO FREE UP LABOUR TIME FOR MORE REMUNERATIVE ACTIVITIES.","[MANDA, DAMIANO K.; MWAKUBO, SAMUEL] AFRICAN ECON RES CONSORTIUM, NAIROBI, KENYA.","MANDA, DK (REPRINT AUTHOR), 3RD FLOOR MIDDLE EAST BANK TOWERS BLDG,MILIMAN RD, NAIROBI, KENYA.","DAMIANO.MANDA@AERCAFRICA.ORG",NA,NA,"AFRICAN PARTNERSHIP FORUM (APF), 2007, 8 M AFR PARTN FOR BE; BERIK G, 2009, FEM ECON, V15, P1, DOI 10.1080/13545700903093524; BRAUNSTEIN E, 2011, FEM ECON, V17, P5, DOI 10.1080/13545701.2011.602354; BUDLENDER D., 2002, GENDER BUDGETS MAKE; DEERE CD, 2012, DEV CHANGE, V43, P505, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7660.2012.01764.X; DEERE CD, 2006, FEM ECON, V12, P1, DOI 10.1080/13545700500508056; DUTT A.

THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE EITHER THE RESULT OF SUPPLY-SIDE DISCRIMINATION, OR DIFFERENCES IN PROFITABILITY BETWEEN FEMALE- AND MALE-OWNED FIRMS. THIS PAPER AIMS AT ANALYSING WHETHER THESE DIFFERENCES ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE CASE OF ITALIAN FIRMS BY MEANS OF A LARGE DATASET ON LINES OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THREE ITALIAN BANKS OVER THE PERIOD 2005-2008. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS SHOW THAT FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AND YOUNGER THAN MALE-OWNED ONES, AND HAVE-ON AVERAGE-A LARGER, BUT SHORTER, NUMBER OF LENDING RELATIONSHIPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MEAN SIZE OF LOANS REQUESTED BY FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS IS SMALLER, AND MORE FREQUENTLY ASSISTED WITH COLLATERAL, PERSONAL GUARANTEES, OR BOTH. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR LOAN, FIRM AND BANK CHARACTERISTICS, ESTIMATES SHOW THAT GENDER DOES NOT AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBTAINING A BANK LOAN. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS, GUARANTEES ARE LESS POWERFUL INSTRUMENTS IN GAINING ACCESS TO CREDIT AND THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING TO PLEDGE COLLATERAL IS HIGHER THAN FOR MALE-OWNED FIRMS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENCES IN CREDIT ACCESS ARE THE RESULT OF DISCRIMINATION AND STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE- AND FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS. POLICIES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS OF FEMALE-OWNED FIRMS TO BANK LOANS SHOULD FAVOR AN INCREASE IN FIRM SIZE THAT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF MORE SOPHISTICATED BUSINESS LEGAL STRUCTURES.","[CALCAGNINI, GIORGIO; GIOMBINI, GERMANA; LENTI, ELISA] UNIV URBINO, DEPT ECON SOC POLIT, VIA SAFFI 42, I-61029 URBINO, PU, ITALY.; [CALCAGNINI, GIORGIO; GIOMBINI, GERMANA] MO FI R, ANCONA, ITALY.","GIOMBINI, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV URBINO, DEPT ECON SOC POLIT, VIA SAFFI 42, I-61029 URBINO, PU, ITALY.","GIORGIO.CALCAGNINI@UNIURB.IT; GERMANA.GIOMBINI@UNIURB.IT",NA,NA,"AI CR, 2003, ECON LETT, V80, P123, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00032-6; ALESINA AF, 2013, J EUR ECON ASSOC, V11, P45, DOI 10.1111/J.1542-4774.2012.01100.X; ASIEDU E, 2012, AM ECON REV, V102, P532, DOI 10.1257/AER.102.3.532; ATERIDO R, 2011, 5571 WORLD BANK; BANK OF ITALY, 2010, STAT B; BECKER G., 1971, EC DISCRIMINATION; BELLUCCI A, 2010, J BANK FINANC, V34, P2968, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2010.07.008; BERGER AN, 1995, J BUS, V68, P351, DOI 10.1086/296668; BERGER AN, 1990, J MONETARY ECON, V25, P21, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(90)90042-3; BERGER AN, 1998, J BANK FINANC, V22, P613, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7; BONTE W, 2013, SMALL BUS ECON, V41, P961, DOI 10.1007/S11187-012-9459-3; BOOT AWA, 1994, INT ECON REV, V35, P899, DOI 10.2307/2527003; BOOT AWA, 1991, ECON J, V101, P458, DOI 10.2307/2233552; CALCAGNINI G, 2008, VINCOLI FINANZIARI C, P45; CALCAGNINI G, 2014, APPL FINANCIAL EC, V6, P397, DOI DOI 10.1080/09603107.2014.881967; CARTER S., 2006, WOMENS BUSINESS OWNE; CESARONI F, 2010, EC PICCOLA IMPRESA, P131; CESARONI F, 2013, QUESTIONI EC E FINAN, P177; COIN D, 2011, ARE WOMEN ENTREPRENE; COLE RA, 2011, 383 FRB, DOI [10.2139/SSRN.1799649, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.1799649]; COLEMAN S, 2009, SMALL BUS ECON, V33, P397, DOI 10.1007/S11187-009-9205-7; FAIRLIE RW, 2009, SMALL BUS ECON, V33, P375, DOI 10.1007/S11187-009-9207-5; FAY M, 1993, J BUS VENTURING, V8, P363, DOI 10.1016/0883-9026(93)90005-P; GREENE W.

GENDER, NUMBER OF YEARS OF SCHOOLING, MARITAL STATUS, PARTICIPATION IN AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES, OFF-FARM EMPLOYMENT, AND OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR A MALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLD POSITIVELY INFLUENCED DISCRIMINATION IN OBTAINING CREDIT AND THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT OBTAINED. MOREOVER, THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING RESULTS FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE INCREASE IN THE CREDIT OBTAINED BY MALES WAS 220,000 VIETNAMESE DONG (VND) AND THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOUR OF MEN.

THIS PAPER USES THE ZERO-INFLATED NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION MODEL FOR COUNT PANEL DATA OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN VIETNAM TO EXAMINE THE ISSUE ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND FIRM SIZES OVER TIME. RESULTS INDICATE THAT WOMEN-LED ENTERPRISES HAVE A 34% HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF LOANS BEING DENIED THAN MEN-LED FIRMS. THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE SERIOUS DEPENDING ON INDUSTRY AND MACROPOLICY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE GAP IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOANS BEING DENIED BETWEEN WOMEN-LED ENTERPRISES AND THEIR MEN-LED COUNTERPARTS INCREASES TO 67% IN MALE-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES AND 71% IN PERIODS OF TIGHT MONETARY POLICY.

USING DATA COLLECTED FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) LENDING PLATFORMS IN CHINA, WE INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN ONLINE P2P CREDIT LENDING MARKET IN CHINA. THE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT FEMALE BORROWERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FUNDED THAN MALE BORROWERS; BUT IN EXCHANGE FOR HIGHER FUNDING SUCCESS, FEMALE BORROWERS ARE FOUND TO PAY HIGHER INTEREST RATES. MOREOVER, THE DEFAULT RATES OF LOANS FROM FEMALE BORROWERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE FROM MALE BORROWERS. FINALLY, WE FOUND THAT A BORROWER'S GENDER MODERATES THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE BORROWER' ATTRIBUTES AND LENDING OUTCOMES. THE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT PROFIT-BASED STATISTICAL DISCRIMINATION AND COSTLY TASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION CO-EXIST IN THIS ONLINE PEER-TO-PEER LENDING MARKET, BUT THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THE DISCRIMINATIONS ARE DIFFERENT.

WE ALSO FIND THAT THOSE LARGE NON-STATE FIRMS WITH WEAK GOVERNMENT CONNECTIONS, LIKELY THE ENGINE FOR INNOVATION IN THE COMING YEARS IN CHINA, ARE ESPECIALLY FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED, DUE PERHAPS TO THE FORMIDABLE HOLD THAT THEIR STATE RIVALS HAVE ON FINANCIAL RESOURCES AFTER THE 'GRABBING-THE-BIG-AND-LETTING-GO-THE-SMALL' PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM IN CHINA.

VARIABILITY IN BANKS' FINANCIAL HEALTH FOLLOWING THE 2008 CRISIS IS USED AS AN EXOGENOUS DETERMINANT OF FIRMS' ACCESS TO CREDIT. FINDINGS, RELATIVE TO THE BELGIAN ECONOMY, CLEARLY HIGHLIGHT THAT CREDIT MATTERS. THEY SHOW THAT SMES BORROWING MONEY FROM PRE-CRISIS FINANCIALLY LESS HEALTHY BANKS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY A CREDIT CONSTRAINT AND, IN TURN, TO ADJUST THEIR LABOUR INPUT DOWNWARDS THAN PRE-CRISIS CLIENTS OF MORE HEALTHY BANKS. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST ACROSS TYPES OF LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT WERE DENIED CREDIT, I.E. APPLICATIONS TO FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT OR NEW INVESTMENTS. YET, ESTIMATES ALSO SHOW THAT CREDIT CONSTRAINTS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL FOR EMPLOYMENT AMONG SMES EXPERIENCING A NEGATIVE DEMAND SHOCK OR FACING STRONG PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION.

IT INTENDS TO SHOW THE INFLUENCE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS' CHARACTERISTICS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION, USING THE WORLD BANK GLOBAL FINDEX DATABASE 2014 FOR 16 COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH-A PROBIT MODEL IS USED TO EXAMINE THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE MENAP REGION. THESE CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDE GENDER, AGE, INCOME AND EDUCATION. INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE LINKED TO THE MAIN FINANCIAL-INCLUSION INDICATORS INCLUDE HAVING A FORMAL ACCOUNT AND FORMAL SAVING AND BORROWING. THE BARRIERS TO HAVING A FORMAL ACCOUNT, ALTERNATIVE BORROWING SOURCES ANDMOTIVATIONS FOR BORROWING ARE ALSO LINKED TO THE RESPONDENTS' CHARACTERISTICS. FINDINGS-THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT FEMALES AND THE POOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, WHILE EDUCATION LEVEL ENHANCES FINANCIAL INCLUSION. AS DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE CONSIDER ACCESS TO CREDIT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVING THEIR LIVES, THE STUDY FINDS THAT THE POOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BORROW FOR MEDICAL ISSUES THAN FOR OTHER NEEDS. WHILE ISLAM IS THE MAJORITY RELIGION IN THE MENAP REGION, IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A BARRIER TO HAVING A FORMAL BANK ACCOUNT. FURTHERMORE, PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT INCOME QUINTILES ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE INFORMAL FINANCIAL SOURCES, WHILE THE EDUCATED ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE FORMAL ONES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS-THE RESULTS SHOW THAT POLICYMAKERS IN MENAP SHOULD MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AS A WAY TO ENHANCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION. ALSO, GOVERNMENTS INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS CENTRAL BANKS, FINANCIAL MINISTRIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, COULD BUILD ON THESE RESULTS TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AS A WAY TOWARD DEVELOPMENT IN THE MENAP REGION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE-TO THE AUTHOR'S BEST KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUALS' CHARACTERISTICS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN THE MENAP REGION.","[SHIHADEH, FADI HASSAN] PALESTINE TECH UNIV, TULKARM, PALESTINE.","SHIHADEH, FH (REPRINT AUTHOR), PALESTINE TECH UNIV, TULKARM, PALESTINE.","FADIH20@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"AKUDUGU M.A., 2013, RES J FINANCE ACCOUN, V4, P1; ALLEN F, 2016, J FINANC INTERMED, V27, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JFI.2015.12.003; ANSON JOSE, 2013, 6630 WORLD BANK; ARDIC O.P., 2011, 5537 WORLD BANK; BAUM C.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ENDOGENEITY AND SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS, THE AUTHORS DRAW FROM THE THEORY OF IMPACT EVALUATION IN NONRANDOM EXPERIMENT, EMPLOYING THE ENDOGENOUS SWITCHING REGRESSION (ESR) WHILE USING THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM) TO CHECK FOR ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT MEAN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT AND THOSE THAT DID NOT HAVE ACCESS. FURTHER, THE RESULTS REVEALED FARM SIZE, LABOR; GENDER, AGE, LITERACY, WEALTH AND GROUP MEMBERSHIP AS THE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF BOTH CREDIT ACCESS AND INCOME IN THE TWO ZONES. WITH THE ESR, CREDIT ACCESS INCREASES HOUSEHOLDS FARM INCOME BY GH & 206.56/HA AND GH & 39.74/HA IN THE TRANSITIONAL AND SAVANNA ZONES, RESPECTIVELY, BUT WITH THE PSM, CREDIT INCREASES FARM INCOME BY GH & 201.50 AND GH & 45.69 AND IN THE TRANSITIONAL AND SAVANNA, RESPECTIVELY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE MEAN DIFFERENCES IN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOUSEHOLDS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLD'S COVARIATES IN THE TWO ZONES. THE RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES, INFORMATION AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS IN IMPROVED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND FARM INCOME. ALSO, THE RESULTS FROM BOTH METHODS INDICATE THAT CREDIT ACCESS LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN FARM INCOME FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH ZONES. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES EXIST IN THE RESULTS OF PSM AND THAT OF THE ESR RESULTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS IN THE SAMPLES SUGGESTS THAT THE USE OF ESR AND PSM TECHNIQUES IS APPROPRIATE. FURTHER, THE RESULTS SUGGESTING THAT ENHANCED CREDIT ACCESS AND FARM INCOME COULD BE ATTAINED THROUGH IMPROVED ACCESS TO HOUSEHOLD RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THE NEED FOR ESTABLISHING AND EXPANDING CREDIT PROGRAMS TO COVER MORE HOUSEHOLDS IN BOTH ZONES. THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF CREDIT BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS EMPLOYED IN EACH ZONE REVEALED THE WEAKNESS OF EACH MODEL. THE LOW VALUES FROM PSM COULD INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF SELECTION BIAS RESULTING FROM UNOBSERVABLE FACTORS WHILES THE HIGH VALUES FROM THE ESR COULD STEM FROM THE RESTRICTIVE ASSUMPTION OF THE MODEL. THIS REINFORCES THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBINING MIXED METHODS TO CHECK ROBUSTNESS OF RESULTS AND TO EXPLORE THE WEAKNESS OF EACH METHOD EMPLOYED.

WHEN MBES DO RECEIVE BANK FINANCING, THEY GET SMALLER LOANS THAN WHITES. TWO ASPECTS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE TROUBLESOME. FIRST, URBAN MBES ARE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED GEOGRAPHICALLY IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES, RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING FINANCING REFLECT FIRM LOCATION, MINORITY OWNERSHIP, OR BOTH. SECOND, APPLICABLE STUDIES REST ON WEAK THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS. THE AUTHORS' FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BANKS ENGAGE IN DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES LIMITING CREDIT AVAILABILITY TO MBES. CONTROLLING FOR RISK FACTORS, HOWEVER, FIRM LOCATION IN A MINORITY OR INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS NO APPARENT IMPACT ON LOAN AVAILABILITY OR SIZE. OWNER RACE/ETHNICITY, IN CONTRAST, IS IMPORTANT.

LARGE-SCALE CREDIT AGGREGATION CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY THE USE OF MODERN BANKS. HOWEVER, RURAL CONSUMERS MAY RESIST THE USE OF BANKS AS OBJECTS OF NONLOCAL ORIGIN. THE AUTHORS RELY ON THE CLASSIC THEORY OF DEMAND AGGREGATION ADVANTAGE TO CRITICALLY ANALYZE THE PUBLIC POLICY FRAMEWORK UNDERPINNING RURAL BANKING FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF BOTTOM-OF-THE-PYRAMID COUNTRIES. AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE FRAMEWORK IN GHANA'S RURAL BANKING PROGRAMS SHOWS THAT DEMAND AGGREGATION ADVANTAGE PREDICTS CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH THE INCLUSIVE LENDING PRACTICES OF BANKING INSTITUTIONS AMONG EXISTING CLIENTS BUT NOT NEW CLIENTS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY EMPLOYED A PROBIT MODEL WITH MARGINAL EFFECTS AND A GENERALIZED BLINDER-OAXACA DECOMPOSITION ESTIMATION ON A RANDOMLY SELECTED DATA OF 1,239 ENTREPRENEURS FROM EIGHT COMMERCIAL BANKS' CREDIT RECORDS ABOUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL, FIRM AND LOAN CHARACTERISTICS. FINDINGS - THE STUDY REVEALED THAT CREDIT RATIONING PERSISTS AND THAT APPLYING FOR A RELATIVELY LONGER PAYMENT PERIOD, PROVIDING COLLATERAL AND GUARANTOR, BEING ILLITERATE, BEING RELATIVELY OLDER AND BEING IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CREDIT RATIONED, WHILE HAVING SOME RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK, HAVING NON-MANDATORY SAVINGS AND APPLYING FROM A BANK WITH RELATIVELY HIGH INTEREST RATES REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING CREDIT RATIONED. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED A CREDIT GAP OF 17.77 PERCENT AND A POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BORROWERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AS THE GAP WAS LARGELY BEING INFLUENCED BY UNEXPLAINED FACTORS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE RESEARCH WAS INTENDED TO COVER A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL BANKS IN GHANA. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE BANKS WERE UNWILLING TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BORROWERS; HENCE, THE RESEARCH WAS LIMITED TO ONLY EIGHT COMMERCIAL BANKS WHO PROVIDED THE AUTHOR WITH THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE STUDY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT POLICIES THAT ENHANCE HUMAN CAPITAL, WOMEN, AND OLDER ACCESS TO CREDIT AND AGRICULTURAL-ORIENTED FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OTHERS, WILL GO A LONG WAY TO REDUCE RATIONING AND INCREASE ACCESS TO CREDIT, ESPECIALLY TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESEARCH PROPOSES THE USE OF GROUP LENDING AS A FORM OF COLLATERAL AND MONITORING TO EASE RISKS AND DEFAULT, AND HENCE SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO INCREASE ACCESS AND OUTREACH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER LOOKS AT THE COMPREHENSIVE WAY ABOUT THE VARIOUS FACTORS DETERMINING CREDIT RATIONING IN THAT IT CONSIDERS NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL, ECONOMIC/FIRM AND LOAN CHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISCRIMINATION TOWARD THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR EXISTS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANKS CREDIT MARKET.","[SACKEY, FRANK GYIMAH] CATHOLIC UNIV COLL GHANA, DEPT ECON, SUNYANI, GHANA.","SACKEY, FG (REPRINT AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV COLL GHANA, DEPT ECON, SUNYANI, GHANA.","FRANKSACKEY@YAHOO.COM",NA,NA,"ABARU BM, 2006, AGRIC FINANCE REV, V66, P215, DOI 10.1108/00214660680001188; ACQUAH P.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH-THE STUDY ADOPTED THE DIRECT APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF CREDIT RATIONING. THIS INVOLVES THE USE OF SURVEYS PERMITTING LOAN APPLICANTS TO REPORT ON THEIR CREDIT MARKET EXPERIENCES. THE MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE SURVEY DATA TO ARRIVE AT THE FINDINGS REPORTED. FINDINGS-THE STUDY AMONGST OTHER THINGS CONFIRMS THE EXISTENCE OF CREDIT RATIONING IN THE SME SECTOR. IT ALSO REVEALED THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH SMES ARE RATIONED VARIES AND THESE VARIATIONS ARE DETERMINED BY THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SME OWNER AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUSINESS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS-THE USE OF THE SURVEY METHOD IN INVESTIGATING CREDIT RATIONING COULD INTRODUCE SOME BIASES IN THE RESPONSES OBTAINED. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA DID NOT PERMIT THE USE OF THE INDIRECT METHOD WHICH IS BASED ON THE TESTING FOR POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE PERMANENT INCOME HYPOTHESIS. DESPITE ITS WEAKNESS, THE SURVEY METHOD REMAINS THE MORE REALISTIC APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ESPECIALLY IN THE DATA-CONSTRAINED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE DESIGN AND PILOTING OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE AS WELL AS THE USE A LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ALL WENT A LONG WAY TO REDUCE ANY POSSIBLE BIASES IN THE RESPONSES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE-DESPITE THE FACT THAT A NUMBER OF STUDIES EXIST ON SME FINANCING PROBLEM IN GHANA, AVAILABLE STUDIES PRESENT THE PROBLEM AS IF IT WERE THE SAME FOR ALL SMES. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SMES MAY BE RATIONED IN THE CREDIT MARKET TO DIFFERENT EXTENTS, CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO KNOWN STUDIES THAT HAVE EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATED THE VARIOUS DEGREES OF RATIONING AND FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SMES MAY BE CREDIT RATIONED.

IT MAINLY FOCUSES ON TWO DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION E.G., INCLUSION BY COMMERCIAL BANKS AND BY MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS (MFIS). AS THE FORMAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEAL WITH WEALTHY AND WELL-OFF CLIENTS, WHEREAS THE MFIS CLAIM TO BE THE BANKERS OF POOR. A LARGE NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE ARE STILL UN-BANKED IN LOW INCOME COUNTRIES; HOWEVER, RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENT FINANCE SUGGESTS THAT ACCESSIBLE AND TIMELY FINANCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING POOR OUT OF POVERTY. THE IMPORTANCE OF MFIS IN PROVIDING CREDIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AT THE DOORSTEP OF FINANCIALLY EXCLUDED HOUSEHOLDS IS GLOBALLY ACKNOWLEDGED. THUS, IT IS INEVITABLE TO INVESTIGATE THE DETERMINANTS OF (MFIS)/FINANCIAL INCLUSION PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN THE FIRST STEP OF DATA ANALYSIS, WE FIND POSITIVE ASSOCIATION OF ICT DIFFUSION WITH FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH POVERTY & INEQUALITY. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE POVERTY REDUCING EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION MEASURED EITHER WAY. IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ICT DIMENSIONS WHEN USED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION ACCELERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND REDUCE POVERTY & INEQUALITY. THEREFORE, POLICIES TO PROMOTE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE COULD STIMULATE FINANCIAL INCLUSION BY PROMOTING DIGITAL FINANCE. MOREOVER, BETTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN ICT AND FINANCIAL SECTOR WILL LIKELY TO ADVANCE DIGITAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION THAT COULD HELP TO BRIDGE THE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE GAP.","[MUSHTAQ, RIZWAN] UNIV JEAN MOULIN LYON 3, CTR RECH MAGELLAN IAELYON, LYON, FRANCE.; [BRUNEAU, CATHERINE] UNIV PARIS 1 PANTHEON SORBONNE, CTR ECON SORBONNE, PARIS, FRANCE.","MUSHTAQ, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV JEAN MOULIN LYON 3, CTR RECH MAGELLAN IAELYON, LYON, FRANCE.","RIZWANHCC@GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"AHLIN C, 2008, J DEV ECON, V86, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2007.08.002; AHLIN C, 2011, J DEV ECON, V95, P105, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2010.04.004; ALESINA A, 2003, J ECON GROWTH, V8, P155, DOI 10.1023/A:1024471506938; ALTER ADRIAN, 2015, 15235 IMF; ANDRIANOVA S, 2011, WORLD DEV, V39, P686, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2010.10.001; ANSON JOSE, 2013, 6630 WORLD BANK; BANGOURA L, 2016, REV ECON POLIT, V126, P789, DOI 10.3917/REDP.265.0789; BAZILLIER R, 2017, J ECON SURV, V31, P463, DOI 10.1111/JOES.12150; BECK T, 2000, J FINANC ECON, V58, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(00)00072-6; BECK T, 2007, J ECON GROWTH, V12, P27, DOI 10.1007/S10887-007-9010-6; BECK THORSTEN, ECB WORKING PAPER SE, V2011, P1295; BECK THORSTEN, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V2010, P5442; BERGER E, 2013, J PROD INNOVAT MANAG, V30, P1199, DOI 10.1111/JPIM.12054; BHAVNANI ASHEETA, 2008, ROLE MOBILE PHONES S; BRUHN M, 2014, J FINANC, V69, P1347, DOI 10.1111/JOFI.12091; BURGESS R, 2005, J EUR ECON ASSOC, V3, P268, DOI 10.1162/JEEA.2005.3.2-3.268; CECCHINI S., 2003, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT, V10, P73, DOI 10.1002/ITDJ.1590100203; COMIN D, 2009, REV ECON STAT, V91, P229, DOI 10.1162/REST.91.2.229; COMIN DIEGO, 15306 HBS; DATTA A, 2004, APPL ECON, V36, P1649, DOI 10.1080/0003684042000218552; DEMIRGUC-KUNT A., 2014, REV MIDDLE E EC FINA, V10, P177, DOI [10.1515/RMEEF-2013-0062, DOI 10.1515/RMEEF-2013-0062]; DUFLO ESTHER, 2013, 18950 NBER; GRACE JEREMY, 2004, 12 WORLD BANK WORK; GREENWOOD JEREMY, 1990, J POLITICAL EC 1, V98; GUISO L, 2004, Q J ECON, V119, P929, DOI 10.1162/0033553041502162; HEEKS RICHARD, 1999, INFORM COMMUNICATION; HERMES N, 2014, APPL ECON, V46, P1021, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2013.864039; HONOHAN P, 2008, J BANK FINANC, V32, P2493, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2008.05.004; HUANG YF, 2010, WORLD DEV, V38, P1667, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2010.04.001; IMAI KS, 2012, WORLD DEV, V40, P1675, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2012.04.013; IMAI KS, 2012, J DEV STUD, V48, P633, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2012.661853; IMAI KS, 2010, WORLD DEV, V38, P1760, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2010.04.006; INOUE T, 2013, [NO TITLE CAPTURED], V23, P1567, DOI DOI 10.1080/09603107.2013.839859; JEANNENEY SG, 2011, J DEV STUD, V47, P143, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2010.506918; KAI H, 2009, [NO TITLE CAPTURED], V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.5296/RAE.V1I1; KENDALL JAKE, 2010, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V5253; KING RG, 1993, J MONETARY ECON, V32, P513, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(93)90028-E; KPODAR KANGNI, 2011, 1173 IMF; LAPORTA R, 1997, J FINANC, V52, P1131, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.1997.TB02727.X; LEE SH, 2012, APPL ECON, V44, P461, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2010.508730; LEVINE R, 2005, HANDB ECON, V22, P865; LEWIN DAVID, 2005, TECHNICAL REPORT; LO PRETE A, 2013, ECON LETT, V118, P74, DOI 10.1016/J.ECONLET.2012.09.029; MAKSUDOVA NARGIZA, 423 CERGEEI; MARK JA, 1987, MON LABOR REV, V110, P26; MAY C, 2015, INT POLIT ECON SER, P83; MBITI ISAAC, 2011, WORKING PAPER SERIES, V17129; MCINTOSH C, 2011, WORLD DEV, V39, P922, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2011.03.001; MISHRA V, 2013, TELECOMMUN POLICY, V37, P503, DOI 10.1016/J.TELPOL.2012.10.004; NACEUR S.B., 2016, 1632 IMF; PARK CYN-YOUNG, 2015, WORKING PAPER SERIES, V426; PRADHAN RP, 2015, TECHNOL SOC, V42, P135, DOI 10.1016/J.TECHSOC.2015.04.002; PRESBITERO AF, 2016, ECON NOTES, V45, P445, DOI 10.1111/ECNO.12069; RAND J, 2002, WORLD DEV, V30, P2071, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00124-9; ROY MARC-ANDRE, 2003, MICROFINANCE TOOL DE; SARMA M, 2011, J INT DEV, V23, P613, DOI 10.1002/JID.1698; SASSI S, 2013, TELECOMMUN POLICY, V37, P252, DOI 10.1016/J.TELPOL.2012.12.004; SCHUMPETER JOSEPH ALOIS, 1911, THEORIE WIRTSCHAFTLI, P1911; SHAMIM F, 2007, J ECON STUD, V34, P352, DOI 10.1108/01443580710817452; SNOW DR, 2001, POLICY STUD J, V29, P296, DOI 10.1111/J.1541-0072.2001.TB02093.X; SVIRYDZENKA K., 2016, 165 IMF; TERBERGER EVA, 2003, CEPAL REV, V81, P187; THOMEE S, 2011, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V11, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-11-66; TIWARI M., 2008, EUR J DEV RES, V20, P448; VANROOSE A, 2013, APPL ECON, V45, P1965, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2011.641932; WARREN M, 2007, TELECOMMUN POLICY, V31, P374, DOI 10.1016/J.TELPOL.2007.04.001; WAVERMAN L., 2005, VODAFONE POLICY PAPE, V2, P10","67",0,"0","2","2","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0160-791X","1879-3274","TECHNOL SOC","TECHNOL.

IN 2004, THE KMT WAS EXPECTED TO WIN, BUT EVENTUALLY LOST TO THE DPP. WE USE THESE TWO EXOGENOUS EVENTS TO INVESTIGATE THREE ISSUES: HOW POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ARE RELATED TO PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS, HOW THE ENTRENCHED POSITION OF THE RULING PARTY AFFECTS THE TYPES OF PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS AND HOW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS RELATED TO PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS. WE FIND THAT KMT-CONNECTED (DPP-CONNECTED) FIRMS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER (LOWER) ABNORMAL RETURNS BEFORE THE 2004 ELECTION. THIS PATTERN OF RETURNS WAS REVERSED AFTER THE UNEXPECTED RESULT. MOREOVER, WE FIND THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS. HOWEVER, THE TYPES OF PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS DIFFERED BETWEEN KMT-CONNECTED AND DPP-CONNECTED FIRMS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE ENTRENCHED POWER OF THE RULING PARTY. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH PREFERENTIAL BANK LOANS, PROBABLY BECAUSE FIRMS WITH GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HAVE MORE ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SOURCES.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER TAKES A CAPPED BARRIER OPTION APPROACH TO THE MARKET VALUATION OF THE EQUITY OF THE BANK AND THE LIABILITY OF THE DEPOSIT INSURER. THE CAP DEMONSTRATES THE DYNAMICS OF A POLITICALLY CONNECTED BORROWING FIRM'S ASSET AND HIGHLIGHTS THE TRUNCATED NATURE OF LOAN PAYOFFS. THE BARRIER ADDRESSES THAT DEFAULT CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE MATURITY DATE. THE BANK PARTICIPATING IN A GOVERNMENT CAPITAL INJECTION PROGRAM IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRM THAT HAS PREFERENTIAL ACCESS TO FINANCING. FINDINGS POLITICAL CONNECTION AS SUCH MAKES THE BANK MORE PRONE TO RISK TAKING AT A REDUCED INTEREST MARGIN, PRODUCES GREATER SAFETY FOR THE BANK OWING TO GOVERNMENT CAPITAL INJECTIONS, AND LEADS TO INCREASING THE FAIR DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUM. THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTION ON THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE PREMIUM, WHICH IGNORES THE CAP AND THE BARRIER YIELDS SIGNIFICANT OVER-ESTIMATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE STUDY ON THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED BORROWING FIRM SHOWS THAT POLITICAL CONNECTION IS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE DISTRESSED BANK'S PERFORMANCE, YIELDING THE POLITICAL-CONNECTION COST OF A REDUCED BANK INTEREST MARGIN AND THE POLITICAL-CONNECTION BENEFIT OF A REDUCED BANK EQUITY RISK, CONTRIBUTING THE LITERATURE ON POLITICAL CONNECTION AND BANK BAILOUT.","[LIN, JYH-HORNG] TAMKANG UNIV, NEW TAIPEI, TAIWAN.; [CHEN, SHI] SOUTHWESTERN UNIV FINANCE & ECON, SCH ECON, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [HUANG, FU-WEI] TAMKANG UNIV, DEPT MANAGEMENT SCI, NEW TAIPEI, TAIWAN.","CHEN, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), SOUTHWESTERN UNIV FINANCE & ECON, SCH ECON, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.","CHENSHI@SWUFE.EDU.CN",NA,NA,"AL-DHAMARI R, 2015, INT J MANAG FINANC, V11, P215, DOI 10.1108/IJMF-02-2014-0016; BAYAZITOVA D, 2012, REV FINANC STUD, V25, P377, DOI 10.1093/RFS/HHR121; BERGER AN, 2013, J FINANC ECON, V109, P146, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2013.02.008; BOUBAKRI N, 2012, J CORP FINANC, V18, P541, DOI 10.1016/J.JCORPFIN.2012.02.005; CHEN AH, 2006, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V38, P375, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2006.0028; CHEN YS, 2014, J FINANC SERV RES, V45, P287, DOI 10.1007/S10693-013-0167-1; CLAESSENS S, 2008, J FINANC ECON, V88, P554, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.11.003; CROUHY M, 1991, J BANK FINANC, V15, P73, DOI 10.1016/0378-4266(91)90038-N; DE JONGH E, 2013, S AFR J ECON MANAG S, V16, P364, DOI 10.4102/SAJEMS.V16I4.440; DERMINE J., 2001, J ECON BUS, V53, P497; DICKO S, 2017, INT J MANAG FINANC, V13, P358, DOI 10.1108/IJMF-01-2017-0010; EPISCOPOS A, 2008, J BANK FINANC, V32, P1677, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2007.11.018; FACCIO M, 2006, AM ECON REV, V96, P369, DOI 10.1257/000282806776157704; FACCIO M., 2003, WORKING PAPER; FACCIO M, 2006, J FINANC, V61, P2597, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.2006.01000.X; FACCIO M, 2010, FINANC MANAGE, V39, P905, DOI 10.1111/J.1755-053X.2010.01099.X; HAMILTON JESSE, 2013, BLOOMBERG; HOSHI T, 2010, J FINANC ECON, V97, P398, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2010.02.005; JOHNSON S, 2003, J FINANC ECON, V67, P351, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(02)00255-6; KASMAN A, 2010, ECON MODEL, V27, P648, DOI 10.1016/J.ECONMOD.2010.01.004; KHWAJA AI, 2005, Q J ECON, V120, P1371, DOI 10.1162/003355305775097524; MERTON RC, 1973, BELL J ECON, V4, P141, DOI 10.2307/3003143; NYS E, 2015, J FINANC STABIL, V19, P83, DOI 10.1016/J.JFS.2015.01.004; SAPIENZA P, 2004, J FINANC ECON, V72, P357, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2002.10.002; VANHOOSE D, 2007, J BANK FINANC, V31, P3680, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2007.01.015; WONG KP, 1997, J BANK FINANC, V21, P251, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(96)00037-4; YANG F., 2012, INT J MANAGERIAL FIN, V10, P312","27",0,"0","1","5","EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","BINGLEY","HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND","1743-9132","1758-6569","INT J MANAG FINANC","INT.

THE EVALUATION OF THE CAUSAL EFFECTS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, IS A DIFFICULT TASK AS THEIR ALLOCATION IS TYPICALLY ENDOGENOUS. TO OVERCOME THIS IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM, WE EXPLOIT A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN THE ALLOCATION OF LAND TITLES. IN 1981, SQUATTERS OCCUPIED A PIECE OF LAND IN A POOR SUBURBAN AREA OF BUENOS AIRES. IN 1984, A LAW WAS PASSED EXPROPRIATING THE FORMER OWNERS' LAND TO ENTITLE THE OCCUPANTS. SOME ORIGINAL OWNERS ACCEPTED THE GOVERNMENT COMPENSATION, WHILE OTHERS DISPUTED THE COMPENSATION PAYMENT IN THE SLOW ARGENTINE COURTS. THESE DIFFERENT DECISIONS BY THE FORMER OWNERS GENERATED AN EXOGENOUS ALLOCATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS ACROSS SQUATTERS. USING DATA FROM TWO SURVEYS PERFORMED IN 2003 AND 2007, WE FIND THAT ENTITLED FAMILIES SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED HOUSING INVESTMENT, REDUCED HOUSEHOLD SIZE, AND ENHANCED THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THESE EFFECTS, HOWEVER, DID NOT TAKE PLACE THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESS TO CREDIT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LAND TITLING CAN BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR POVERTY REDUCTION, ALBEIT NOT THROUGH THE SHORTCUT OF CREDIT ACCESS, BUT THROUGH THE SLOW CHANNEL OF INCREASED PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT, WHICH SHOULD HELP TO REDUCE POVERTY IN FUTURE GENERATIONS.

WE ALSO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH THE SOCIAL NETWORKS AFFECT HOUSEHOLDS' PARTICIPATION IN THE INFORMAL FINANCIAL MARKET. BY REDUCING INFORMATION COST, PERCEIVED RISK AND PRECAUTIONARY SAVING, SOCIAL NETWORKS PLAY A LARGER ROLE FOR URBAN HOUSEHOLDS THAN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS. NOTABLY, THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL NETWORKS ON INFORMAL FINANCE ARE STRENGTHENED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORMAL FINANCIAL MARKET.","[CHAI, SHIJUN] XINYANG NORMAL UNIV, BUSINESS SCH, XINYANG, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [CHEN, YANG] XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV, INT BUSINESS SCH SUZHOU, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.; [HUANG, BIHONG] ASIAN DEV BANK INST, TOKYO, JAPAN.; [YE, DEZHU] JINAN UNIV, SCH ECON, GUANGZHOU, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.","CHEN, Y (REPRINT AUTHOR), XIAN JIAOTONG LIVERPOOL UNIV, INT BUSINESS SCH SUZHOU, SUZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.","CHAISHIJUN1204@163.COM; YANG.CHEN@XJTLU.EDU.CN; BIHUANG@ADBI.ORG; TYEDEZHU@JNU.EDU.CN","HENAN PROVINCE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE GENERAL PROJECT [2017BJJ054]; HENAN PROVINCE GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING RESEARCH TENDERING PROJECT [2017B274]; NANHU SCHOLARS AWARD SCHEME YOUTH PROJECT - XINYANG NORMAL UNIVERSITY [XYSY18076]; CHINESE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION LIBERAL ARTS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES FOUNDATION [13YJA790139]; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [71473102]","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE EDITOR AND TWO ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR THEIR INVALUABLE COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS.

WE FIND THAT PRIVATELY CONTROLLED FIRMS IN TRUST-INTENSIVE REGIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OBTAIN LOANS FROM BANKS THAN THOSE IN REGIONS WITH A LOWER LEVEL OF SOCIAL TRUST. THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF TRUST ON ACCESS TO BANK LOANS IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR FIRMS THAT HAVE NO POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, FIRMS THAT ARE LOCATED IN REGIONS WITH POOR LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS, AND FIRMS THAT HIRE LESS REPUTABLE AUDITORS. WE ALSO EXAMINE THE CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH SOCIAL TRUST PROMOTES BANK FINANCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FIRMS IN TRUST-INTENSIVE REGIONS HAVE A LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT AND HIGHER FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT LOANS TO NSOES IN TRUST-INTENSIVE REGIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS, LONGER MATURITY, AND LOWER INTEREST RATE SPREAD.

THROUGH AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION BASED ON THE WORLD BANK ENTERPRISE SURVEY, WE FIND THAT ACCESS TO BANK CREDIT IS VERY HETEROGENEOUS. ON AVERAGE, SMALLER AND LESS PRODUCTIVE FIRMS ARE LESS LIKELY TO APPLY FOR CREDIT AND MORE LIKELY TO BE FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED. BESIDES, A HIGH DEGREE OF BANK PENETRATION AND COMPETITION IS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH A LOWER PROBABILITY THAT BORROWERS ARE FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED. FINALLY, FOREIGN BANKS PENETRATION HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ACCESS TO CREDIT PARTICULARLY IN LESS DEVELOPED AND MORE CONCENTRATED MARKETS, WHILE IT HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN MORE COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIALLY DEVELOPED MARKETS.","[PRESBITERO, ANDREA F.] INT MONETARY FUND, WASHINGTON, DC 20431 USA.; [PRESBITERO, ANDREA F.] MONEY & FINANCE RES GRP MOFIR, ANCONA, ITALY.; [RABELLOTTI, ROBERTA] UNIV PAVIA, DEPT POLIT & SOCIAL SCI, I-27100 PAVIA, ITALY.","PRESBITERO, AF (REPRINT AUTHOR), INT MONETARY FUND, WASHINGTON, DC 20431 USA.; PRESBITERO, AF (REPRINT AUTHOR), MONEY & FINANCE RES GRP MOFIR, ANCONA, ITALY.","APRESBITERO@IMF.ORG; ROBERTA.RABELLOTTI@UNIPV.IT",NA,NA,"BANERJEE A., 2012, REV ECON STUD, V81, P572; BECK T, 2004, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V36, P627, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2004.0039; BECK T, 2006, J INT MONEY FINANC, V25, P932, DOI 10.1016/J.JIMONFIN.2006.07.005; BECK T, 2011, J FINANC SERV RES, V39, P35, DOI 10.1007/S10693-010-0085-4; BERGER AN, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V76, P237, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.06.003; BROWN M, 2011, ECON POLICY, P93, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-0327.2010.00259.X; BRUHN M, 2013, 6442 WORLD BANK; BRUHN M, 2014, WORLD BANK RES OBSER, V29, P186, DOI 10.1093/WBRO/LKU002; CARDIM DE CARVALHO F.

THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON A UNIQUE DATASET OF MANUFACTURING FIRMS THAT COVERS DOZENS OF DEVELOPING AND TRANSITION COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE FIRM'S SENIOR MANAGERS SPEND WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CREDIT ACCESS. EXPLOITING THE CROSS-COUNTRY DIMENSION OF THE DATASET, I THEN SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IS HIGHER IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE BANKING SECTOR IS MORE CONCENTRATED AND HAS HIGHER NET INTEREST MARGIN. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IS LOWER IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CREDIT INFORMATION SHARING MECHANISMS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A COMPETITIVE BANKING SECTOR IMPROVES EFFICIENCY OF CREDIT ALLOCATION BY REDUCING POLITICALLY MOTIVATED LENDING.","UNIV GRONINGEN, NL-9700 AV GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.","LASHITEW, AA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GRONINGEN, POB 800, NL-9700 AV GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.","A.A.LASHITEW@RUG.NL",NA,NA,"ABIAD A, 2008, J DEV ECON, V87, P270, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2007.12.002; AI CR, 2003, ECON LETT, V80, P123, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00032-6; AMEMIYA T, 1984, J ECONOMETRICS, V24, P3, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(84)90074-5; BANERJEE AV, 2005, HANDB ECON, V22, P473; BARTH J.R., 2008, WORLD BANK POLICY RE, V4646; BECK T, 2004, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V36, P627, DOI 10.1353/MCB.2004.0039; BECK T, 2010, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V24, P77, DOI 10.1093/WBER/LHP016; BRANDT L, 2003, J COMP ECON, V31, P387, DOI 10.1016/S0147-5967(03)00080-5; BROWN M, 2009, J FINANC INTERMED, V18, P151, DOI 10.1016/J.JFI.2008.04.002; CETORELLI N, 2001, J FINANC, V56, P617, DOI 10.1111/0022-1082.00339; CLAESSENS S, 2008, J FINANC ECON, V88, P554, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.11.003; DJANKOV S, 2007, J FINANC ECON, V84, P299, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2006.03.004; DU J, 2010, KYKLOS, V63, P530, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6435.2010.00486.X; FACCIO M, 2006, AM ECON REV, V96, P369, DOI 10.1257/000282806776157704; FIRTH M, 2009, J BANK FINANC, V33, P1144, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2008.12.008; FRYE TM, 2011, EUR J POLIT ECON, V27, P642, DOI 10.1016/J.EJPOLECO.2011.06.003; GONZALEZ-PARAMO JM, 2005, KYKLOS, V58, P495, DOI 10.1111/J.0023-5962.2005.00299.X; GREENE W, 2010, ECON LETT, V107, P291, DOI 10.1016/J.ECONLET.2010.02.014; HSIEH CT, 2009, Q J ECON, V124, P1403, DOI 10.1162/QJEC.2009.124.4.1403; HUBBARD RG, 1998, J ECON LIT, V36, P193; KALI R, 1999, J LAW ECON ORGAN, V15, P615, DOI 10.1093/JLEO/15.3.615; KHWAJA AI, 2005, Q J ECON, V120, P1371, DOI 10.1162/003355305775097524; LA PORTA R, 2002, J FINANC, V57, P265, DOI 10.1111/1540-6261.00422; LAMBSDORFF JG, 2003, KYKLOS, V56, P457, DOI 10.1046/J.0023-5962.2003.00233.X; LI HB, 2008, J DEV ECON, V87, P283, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2007.03.001; LI HB, 2006, ECON INQ, V44, P559, DOI 10.1093/EI/CBJ031; MEGGINSON WL, 2005, J BANK FINANC, V29, P1931, DOI 10.1016/J.JBANKFIN.2005.03.005; SCHIANTARELLI FABIO, 1995, BOSTON COLL WORKING, V293; WURGLER J, 2000, J FINANC ECON, V58, P187, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(00)00070-2","29",3,"3","0","14","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0023-5962","1467-6435","KYKLOS","KYKLOS","10.1111/KYKL.12051",NA,"28","ECONOMICS","BUSINESS & ECONOMICS","AI9TG","ISI000337279300005","2020-02-17","","MAY",2014,"67","2","227","254",NA,NA,NA,"LASHITEW, ADDISU/K-7625-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ISI","UNIV GRONINGEN","UNIV GRONINGEN",NA,"LASHITEW AA, 2014, KYKLOS","LASHITEW AA, 2014, KYKLOS"

HOWEVER, THESE POLITICALLY CONNECTED CEOS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO BE PENALIZED FOR THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF THEIR BANKS. OUR EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT POLITICALLY CONNECTED CEOS OF GOVERNMENT BANKS CAN INFLUENCE A BANK'S LENDING DECISIONS BY USING THEIR POLITICAL POWER AND INFLUENCE TO RELAX LENDING STANDARDS AND TO REAP PRIVATE BENEFITS THAT THUS RAISE THEIR BANKS' SENSITIVITY TO A CRISIS.

HOWEVER, ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION IN MICROFINANCE MAY EXIST IN COUNTRIES WITH A SEGREGATED INDIGENOUS POPULATION. WE ASSESSED THIS POSSIBILITY WITH A FIELD EXPERIMENT IN BOLIVIA. THE CONTROLLED LABORATORY EXPERIMENT EVALUATED WHETHER CREDIT OFFICERS REJECTED MICROLOAN APPLICATIONS BASED ON THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF ETHNICITY AND GENDER OF POTENTIAL BORROWERS. POINT ESTIMATES OF A BAYESIAN MIXED-EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION, ESTIMATED WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA, INDICATE THAT NONINDIGENOUS WOMEN HAVE DOUBLE THE CHANCE OF LOAN APPROVAL, BUT INDIGENOUS WOMEN HAVE ONLY 1.5 TIMES THE CHANCE OF LOAN APPROVAL WHEN COMPARED WITH MEN. WHILE THE FINDINGS ABOUT GENDER ARE LIMITED, THE EVIDENCE FOR THE INTERACTION OF GENDER AND ETHNICITY IS MORE ROBUST AND SUGGESTS THE EXISTENCE OF POSITIVE TASTE-BASED DISCRIMINATION FAVORABLE FOR NONETHNIC WOMEN IN BOLIVIA. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS TOWARDS WOMEN PROMOTED BY DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS MUST NOT OVERLOOK ETHNICITY AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR FINANCIAL POLICIES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN PRACTICE, THESE POLICIES SHOULD BE AIMED AT IDENTIFYING AND REDUCING BOTH SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS AND THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION THAT INDIGENOUS WOMEN MAY FACE WHEN TRYING TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO A LOAN.","[GONZALES MARTINEZ, ROLANDO] UNIV AGDER, N-4630 KRISTIANSAND S, NORWAY.; [GONZALES MARTINEZ, ROLANDO; AGUILERA-LIZARAZU, GABRIELA; ROJAS-HOSSE, ANDREA; ARANDA BLANCO, PATRICIA] BAYESIAN INST RES & DEV, LA PAZ, BOLIVIA.","MARTINEZ, RG (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV AGDER, N-4630 KRISTIANSAND S, NORWAY.","ROLANDO.GONZALES@UIA.NO","PARTNERSHIP FOR ECONOMIC POLICY (PEP); DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID) OF THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK AID); GOVERNMENT OF CANADA THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CENTER (IDRC)","THIS RESEARCH WORK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH FINANCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FROM THE PARTNERSHIP FOR ECONOMIC POLICY (PEP) (WWW.PEP-NET.ORG) WITH FUNDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID) OF THE UNITED KINGDOM (OR UK AID), AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CENTER (IDRC).","ABBINK K, 2006, ECON INQ, V44, P614, DOI 10.1093/EI/CB1001; AGGARWAL R, 2015, INT BUS REV, V24, P55, DOI 10.1016/J.IBUSREV.2014.05.008; AGIER I, 2013, SMALL BUS ECON, V41, P263, DOI 10.1007/S11187-012-9429-9; AGIER I, 2013, WORLD DEV, V42, P165, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2012.06.016; AGIER I, 2012, ECON TRANSIT, V20, P271, DOI 10.1111/J.1468-0351.2012.00434.X; ALTONJI JOSEPH G., 1999, HDB LABOR EC C, V3, P3143, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1573-4463(99)30039-0; ARMENDARIZ B., 2010, EC MICROFINANCE; ARROW K., 1973, DISCRIMINATION LABOR, P3; ARYA S, 2013, J ECON BEHAV ORGAN, V95, P175, DOI 10.1016/J.JEBO.2011.05.005; ASIEDU E, 2012, AM ECON REV, V102, P532, DOI 10.1257/AER.102.3.532; BAKLOUTI I., 2013, INT J RES STUDIES MA, V2, P21; BALDWIN SA, 2013, PSYCHOL METHODS, V18, P151, DOI 10.1037/A0030642; BECK T., 2011, 2011027 EUR BANK CTR; BECKER GS, 2010, EC DISCRIMINATION; BEISLAND L.

IN 2003, THE LARGEST NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY INTRODUCED MUCH SMALLER-SCALE LOANS WITHOUT A COLLATERAL REQUIREMENT. THIS SCHEME IS COMMERCIALIZED BUT POTENTIALLY MORE SUITED TO THE CREDIT DEMANDS OF THE POOR. APPLYING PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING WITH THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE METHOD, THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THE EMERGING MICROCREDIT SCHEME HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TARGETING AND IMPROVING THE WELFARE OF THE POOR IN THE ONE YEAR FOLLOWING LOAN DISBURSEMENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH COLLATERAL OWNERSHIP IS NOT AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF PARTICIPATION, RELATIVELY WEALTHIER FAMILIES GAIN ACCESS TO MICROCREDIT. THE IMPACT OF MICROCREDIT ON VARIOUS HOUSEHOLD OUTCOMES IS GENERALLY STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT, EXCEPT FOR SALES OF NONFARM ENTERPRISES FOR THE NONPOOR AND SCHOOLING EXPENDITURES FOR THE POOR. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE MICROCREDIT SCHEME UNDER STUDY MIGHT NOT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON POVERTY ALLEVIATION.","[TAKAHASHI, KAZUSHI; HIGASHIKATA, TAKAYUKI; TSUKADA, KAZUNARI] JETRO, INST DEVELOPING ECON, CHIBA, JAPAN.","TAKAHASHI, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), JETRO, INST DEVELOPING ECON, CHIBA, JAPAN.",NA,NA,NA,"ALEXANDERTEDESC.G, 2010, PERSPECTIVE IN PRESS; ALEXANDERTEDESC.G, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P504; BARNES C, 2001, IMPACT 3 MICROFINANC; BOLNICK BR, 1990, J DEV STUD, V26, P299, DOI 10.1080/00220389008422153; *BPS GRES, 2006, GRES FIG 2005 2006; CALIENDO M, 2008, J ECON SURV, V22, P31, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-6419.2007.00527.X; CHARITONENKO S., 2003, COMMERCIALIZATION MI; CHEMIN M, 2008, J DEV STUD, V44, P463, DOI 10.1080/00220380701846735; COLEMAN BE, 2006, WORLD DEV, V34, P1612, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2006.01.006; DEHEJIA RH, 2002, REV ECON STAT, V84, P151, DOI 10.1162/003465302317331982; DUNN E, 2002, IMPACTS MICROCREDIT; HAMADA M, 2010, DEV ECON, V48, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1746-1049.2010.00097.X; HECKMAN JJ, 1997, REV ECON STUD, V64, P605, DOI 10.2307/2971733; HULME D., 1996, FINANCE POVERTY; JOHNSTON D, 2007, WORLD BANKS C ACC FI; JOHNSTON D, 2008, WORLD BANK ECON REV, V22, P517, DOI 10.1093/WBER/LHN016; KARLAN D, 2007, WORLD BANK DOING IMP, V7; KARLAN DS, 2001, J MICROFINANCE, V3, P75; KONO H, 2010, DEV ECON, V48, P15, DOI 10.1111/J.1746-1049.2010.00098.X; MORDUCH J., 2005, EC MICROFINANCE; MORDUCH JONATHAN, 1998, 211 PRINC U RES PROG; MOSLEY P, 2001, J DEV STUD, V37, P101, DOI 10.1080/00220380412331322061; PITT MM, 2006, ECON DEV CULT CHANGE, V54, P791, DOI 10.1086/503580; PITT MM, 1998, J POLIT ECON, V106, P958, DOI 10.1086/250037; *PROFI, 2005, IND BACKGR PAP MICR; ROODMAN D., 2009, 174 CGD; ROSENBAUM PR, 1983, BIOMETRIKA, V70, P41, DOI 10.1093/BIOMET/70.1.41; SMITH JA, 2005, J ECONOMETRICS, V125, P305, DOI 10.1016/J.JECONOM.2004.04.011; TSUKADA K, 2010, DEV ECON, V48, P102, DOI 10.1111/J.1746-1049.2010.00100.X; WOOLDRIDGE J.M., 2002, ECONOMETRIC ANAL CRO; WORLD BANK, 2006, MAK NEW IND WORK POO","31",16,"16","2","21","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0012-1533",NA,"DEV ECON","DEV.

CONTRARY TO PRIOR RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SMALL OR MICROLOANS PRIMARILY BENEFIT ENTREPRENEURS WHO EXPERIENCE DISADVANTAGES IN THE MARKETPLACE, THE FINDINGS REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN LOAN SOURCE OR LOAN AMOUNT BY GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE FIRM. THE FINDINGS DID REVEAL, HOWEVER, THAT THE MOTIVATIONS (PUSH VS PULL) OF THE ENTREPRENEUR WERE A DETERMINANT OF LOAN SOURCE. FROM THIS, THE AUTHORS BEGIN TO DEVELOP A THEORY OF FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT SMALL LOANS SECURED AT KEY POINTS IN TIME CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON FIRM PERFORMANCE FOR ALL TYPES OF ENTREPRENEURS, NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY BE CLASSIFIED AS ""DISADVANTAGED."" DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DATA FOR THIS STUDY WAS TAKEN FROM THE PANEL STUDY ON ENTREPRENEURIAL DYNAMICS (PSED II). THE AUTHORS FOCUSSED ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MEASURES OVER THE SIX YEARS OF THAT STUDY TO REASSESS EXISTING FINDINGS ON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MICROFINANCE AND UNDERPERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY AMONG WOMEN, ETHNIC AND UNEMPLOYED ENTREPRENEURS, FROM A FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE PERSPECTIVE. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OF SMALL OR MICROLOANS ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OVER TIME BY TRACKING THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL SOURCES, AMOUNT OF MONEY BORROWED, BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS, AND MOTIVATION TO START A BUSINESS (I.E. PUSH OR PULL). FINDINGS - THE RESULTS ALSO REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BY GENDER, ETHNICITY, OR EMPLOYMENT STATUS IN THE SOURCE OF AMOUNTS OF SMALL LOANS SECURED DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BUSINESSES. THUS, CONSISTENT WITH THE THEORY OF FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE, ALL TYPES OF ENTREPRENEURS ENGAGED IN SEEKING OUT SMALL LOANS DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THEIR BUSINESSES' EXISTENCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - ALTHOUGH USING THE PSED II HAS MANY ADVANTAGES, IT IS NOT PROTECTED FROM METHODOLOGICAL PITFALLS. ONE SUCH POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGE IS THE FACT THAT THIS DATABASE ALLOWS THE AUTHORS TO UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF US-BASED NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS, BUT OVERLOOKS OTHER COUNTRIES. FUTURE RESEARCH EFFORTS SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON SURVEYING NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND CULTURES TO EXPAND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN SMALL LOANS AND FINANCIAL SOURCES ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE WORLDWIDE. THIS COULD BE MOST USEFUL FOR INTENSIFYING RESEARCH IN REGIONS THAT GENERATE MORE PUSH AND/OR PULL ENTREPRENEURS. A SECOND DISADVANTAGE INHERENT IN THE PSED IS THAT INTERVIEWS IN FOLLOW-UP SURVEYS MAY HAVE BECOME IMPOSSIBLE OVER TIME, RESULTING IN MISSING DATA. IN ADDITION, THE REASONS FOR BEING UNABLE TO REACH INTERVIEWEES ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEAR. IN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL REALM, THESE REASONS HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BUSINESSES. INTERVIEWEES' BUSINESSES MAY HAVE GONE BANKRUPT, MERGED WITH OTHER FIRMS AND THUS CHANGED CONTACT DETAILS, GONE GLOBAL AND THEREFORE LEFT THE COUNTRY, ETC. (DELMAR AND SHANE, 2003); THESE COULD BIAS THE RESULTS. A FINAL POTENTIAL WEAKNESS IN THE PSED IS THAT THE DATA ARE BASED ON ENTREPRENEURS' SELF-REPORTS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE PRONE TO MANY KINDS OF RESPONSE BIAS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - BY OFFERING PRACTICAL EDUCATION AIMED AT ENHANCING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ENTREPRENEURS, THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN MEET THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE RESEARCH (E.G. DU RIETZ AND HENREKSON, 2000; PARKER, 2004; PFEIFFER AND REIZE, 2000; REYNOLDS ET AL., 2002) ON PERFORMANCE GAPS BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURS WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS AND THOSE EMBARKING ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITH DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS (PUSH VS PULL). IN LINE WITH THE FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE THEORY, THE RESULTS MAY AID GOVERNMENTAL BODIES, EDUCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ORIENTED TOWARD ENTREPRENEURS, AND SMALL BUSINESSES, IN CONSTRUCTING PROGRAMS THAT WILL TRAIN ENTREPRENEURS TO BE ATTENTIVE TO THE DIVERSE RANGE OF POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES, INCLUDING SMALL LOANS AND DIFFERENT FINANCIAL SOURCES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE RESEARCH CHALLENGES THE NECESSITY-OPPORTUNITY SIMPLISTIC CATEGORIZATION AND BUILDS UPON PRIOR WORK IN THE FIELD OF BRICOLAGE, OR THE PRACTICE OF ""MAKING DO WITH WHATEVER IS AT HAND,"" TO BEGIN DEVELOPING A THEORY OF ""FINANCIAL BRICOLAGE."" IT IS THE CONTENTION THAT ALL NEW BUSINESSES ARE RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED DUE TO CHALLENGES POSED BY ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION. THUS, NEW BUSINESSES, IN GENERAL, DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A FULL RANGE OF FUNDING ALTERNATIVES. IN LIGHT OF THIS, SMALL LOANS MAY BE CRITICAL FOR THE SURVIVAL AND SUCCESS OF NOT ONLY NECESSITY-BASED BUSINESSES BUT OPPORTUNITY-BASED BUSINESSES AS WELL. THE RESULTS AND FINDINGS BEAR THIS OUT.","[KARIV, DAFNA] COLL MANAGEMENT ACAD STUDIES, SCH BUSINESS ADM, RISHON LEZIYYON, ISRAEL.; [COLEMAN, SUSAN] UNIV HARTFORD, BARNEY SCH BUSINESS, HARTFORD, CT 06117 USA.","KARIV, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), COLL MANAGEMENT ACAD STUDIES, SCH BUSINESS ADM, RISHON LEZIYYON, ISRAEL.","KARIVD@COLMAN.AC.IL",NA,NA,"AHLIN C, 2011, J DEV ECON, V95, P105, DOI 10.1016/J.JDEVECO.2010.04.004; AIDIS R., 2006, FEMINIST EC, V12, P631; ALDRICH HE, 1990, ANNU REV SOCIOL, V16, P111, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.SO.16.080190.000551; ALSOS GA, 2006, ENTREP THEORY PRACT, V30, P667, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6520.2006.00141.X; ANDERSEN OJ, 2008, ADMIN SOC, V40, P54, DOI 10.1177/0095399707311775; ANG J.S, 1995, J SMALL BUSINESS FIN, V4, P197; ANG JS, 1992, J SMALL BUSINESS FIN, V1, P185; BAGWELL S, 2006, ENVIRON PLANN C, V24, P51, DOI 10.1068/C058; BAKER T, 2003, RES POLICY, V32, P255, DOI 10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00099-9; BAKER T, 2005, ADMIN SCI QUART, V50, P329, DOI 10.2189/ASQU.2005.50.3.329; BAKER T, 2007, J BUS VENTURING, V22, P694, DOI 10.1016/J.JBUSVENT.2006.10.008; BARNEY J, 1991, J MANAGE, V17, P99, DOI 10.1177/014920639101700108; BATES T, 1990, REV ECON STAT, V72, P551, DOI 10.2307/2109594; BECKER G., 1957, EC DISCRIMINATION; BECKER-BLEASE JR, 2007, J BUS VENTURING, V22, P503, DOI 10.1016/J.JBUSVENT.2006.06.003; BERGER AN, 1995, J BUS, V68, P351, DOI 10.1086/296668; BERGER AN, 1998, J BANK FINANC, V22, P613, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7; BIGGS T, 2002, J ECON BEHAV ORGAN, V49, P473, DOI 10.1016/S0167-2681(02)00030-6; BLAKE MK, 2006, VENTUR CAP, V8, P183, DOI 10.1080/13691060500433835; BLOCK J, 2009, J IND COMPET TRADE, V9, P117, DOI 10.1007/S10842-007-0029-3; BOOT AW, 1991, THE ECONOMIC JOURNAL, V10, P458; BRAU J.

WE FIND A HIGH LEVEL OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN CHINA MANIFESTED BY GREATER USE OF FORMAL ACCOUNT AND FORMAL SAVINGS THAN IN THE OTHER BRICS. FINANCIAL EXCLUSION, I.E., NOT HAVING A FORMAL ACCOUNT, IS MAINLY VOLUNTARY. THE USE OF FORMAL CREDIT IS HOWEVER LESS FREQUENT IN CHINA THAN IN THE OTHER BRICS. BORROWING THROUGH FAMILY OR FRIENDS IS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF OBTAINING CREDIT IN ALL THE BRICS COUNTRIES, BUT OTHER CHANNELS FOR BORROWING ARE NOT VERY COMMONLY USED BY INDIVIDUALS IN CHINA. WE FIND THAT HIGHER INCOME, BETTER EDUCATION, BEING A MAN, AND BEING OLDER ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER USE OF FORMAL ACCOUNTS AND FORMAL CREDIT IN CHINA. INCOME AND EDUCATION INFLUENCE THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF BORROWING. OVERALL FINANCIAL INCLUSION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN CHINA, BUT SUCH LIMITED USE OF FORMAL CREDIT CAN CREATE A CHALLENGE FOR FURTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER INC.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL CROSS-COUNTRY STUDIES ON THIS ASPECT, FEW WITHIN-COUNTRY STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. IN THIS CONTEXT, EXPLOITING DISAGGREGATED HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL DATA FOR INDIA, WE ANALYZE THE INTERFACE BETWEEN GENDER AND FINANCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINE WHETHER GENDER MATTERS FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND IF SO, WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THIS RELATIONSHIP. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN BOTH THE ACCESS TO AS WELL AS THE USE OF FINANCE BY GENDER. ON AVERAGE, FEMALE HEADED HOUSEHOLDS ARE 8% LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS FORMAL FINANCE AND 6% MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS INFORMAL FINANCE AS COMPARED TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE HEADED BY MALES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OTHER RELEVANT HOUSEHOLD AND STATE-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING FINANCIAL ACCESS BY HOUSEHOLDS. SIMILAR EVIDENCE CARRIES OVER TO THE USE OF FINANCE: HOUSEHOLDS HEADED BY FEMALE USE 20% LESS CASH LOANS AS COMPARED TO MALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBLE CHANNELS WHICH IMPEDE FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR FEMALE -HEADED HOUSEHOLDS. OUR ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THAT FOR FEMALE -HEADED HOUSEHOLDS, EDUCATION AND WAGES ARE MORE RELEVANT IN EXPLAINING THE ACCESS TO FINANCE WHEREAS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS ARE MUCH MORE GERMANE IN EXPLAINING THE USE OF FINANCE.

ONE COMPONENT OF THE COUNTERARGUMENT HOLDS THAT RELATIONSHIP-BASED LENDING HAS SERVED AS AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CHALLENGE THIS ASSERTION WITH EMPIRICAL FINDINGS THAT SHOW BANK CREDIT ALLOCATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ""CONNECTIONS"" UNDERMINES THE IMPACT OF FINANCE ON INVESTMENT GROWTH. OUR DATA COME FROM VIETNAM, WHERE-LIKE CHINA-THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ARE EXPANDING DRAMATICALLY BUT RULE OF LAW HAS NOT KEPT PACE. ALTHOUGH VIETNAM'S BANKING SECTOR IS IN TRANSITION TOWARD A HEALTHIER SYSTEM, IT STILL ALLOCATES A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CREDIT TO ""CONNECTED"" ENTERPRISES IN LESS COMPETITIVE REGIONS. WE FIND THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE AN INEFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CHANNELING BANK CREDIT TO THE MOST PROFITABLE INVESTORS. USING A TWO-STAGE EMPIRICAL APPROACH, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT BANKS PLACE GREATER VALUE ON CONNECTIONS THAN PERFORMANCE AND THAT THE FIRMS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO BANK LOANS ARE NO MORE PROFITABLE THAN FIRMS WITHOUT THEM. BY SOME MEASURES, CONNECTED FIRMS ARE EVEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABLE. WE CONCLUDE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT THE MOST PROFITABLE INVESTORS IN VIETNAM HAVE FORGONE THE FORMAL BANKING SYSTEM, PREFERRING TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES OUT OF REINVESTED EARNINGS OR INFORMAL LOANS (JEL G21, G28, G30, O12, K11).","[MALESKY, EDMUND J.] UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, GRAD SCH INT RELAT & PACIFIC STUDIES, SAN DIEGO, CA 92103 USA.; [TAUSSIG, MARKUS] HARVARD UNIV, SCH BUSINESS, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.","MALESKY, EJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF SAN DIEGO, GRAD SCH INT RELAT & PACIFIC STUDIES, SAN DIEGO, CA 92103 USA.","EMALESKY@UCSD.EDU; MTAUSSIG@HBS.HARVARD.EDU",NA,NA,"ACEMOGLU D, 2005, J POLIT ECON, V113, P949, DOI 10.1086/432166; ADAMS DW, 1984, UNDERMINING RURAL DE; AKERLOF GA, 1970, Q J ECON, V84, P488, DOI 10.2307/1879431; ALLEN F, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V77, P57, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.06.010; ALLEN FR, 2007, W FIN ASS ANN M; ANH M, 2005, VIETNAM BUSINES 0621; BANERJEE A, 2004, REV ECON STUD, V71, P19, DOI 10.1111/0034-6527.00274; BECK T, 2003, HDB NEW I EC, P251; BECK T, 2005, FINANCE FIRM S UNPUB; BECK T, 2004, 2997 WORLD BANK; BECK T, 2004, FINANCING PATT UNPUB; BERGER AN, 1999, J BANK FINANC, V23, P135, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00125-3; BERGER AN, 1995, J BUS, V68, P351, DOI 10.1086/296668; BERGER AN, 1998, J BANK FINANC, V22, P613, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7; BERGER AN, 2001, J BANK FINANC, V25, P2127, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4266(01)00189-3; BERGER AN, 2002, ECON J, V112, P32, DOI DOI 10.1111/1468-0297.00682; CARLIER A, 2003, INFORMALITY PLAYING; CARLIER A, 2005, VIETNAM PRIVATE SECT; CULL R, 2005, J FINANC ECON, V77, P117, DOI 10.1016/J.JFINECO.2004.05.010; CULL R, 2004, WORLD BANK C SMALL M; DE SOTO H., 2000, MYSTERY CAPITAL; DIAMOND DW, 1991, Q J ECON, V106, P709, DOI 10.2307/2937924; DIAMOND DW, 1991, J POLIT ECON, V99, P689, DOI 10.1086/261775; DO T, 2003, 3120 WORLD BANK; DUFHUES T., 2003, J I INNOVATION DEV T, V7, P29; FAN J, 2005, POLITICALLY CONNECTE; FISMAN R, 2001, AM ECON REV, V91, P1095, DOI 10.1257/AER.91.4.1095; FISMAN R, 2003, [NO TITLE CAPTURED], V3, P1; FRANKS J, 2003, 1003FE01 OXF FIN RES; GAINSBOROUGH M, 2004, HANOI LOCAL GOVT VIE, P259; GERSCHENKRON ALEXANDER, 1962, EC BACKWARDNESS HIST; GIANNETTI MA, 2005, 498 ECB; GREIF A, 1993, AM ECON REV, V83, P525; GREIF A, 1989, J ECON HIST, V61, P1; *GSO, 2006, STAT YB GSO; *GSO, 2005, REAL SIT ENT RES SUR; GUISO L, 2000, 7563 NAT BUR EC RES; HEMLIN M, 1998, WORKING PAPER SERIES, V236; HUANG Y, 2006, CATO J, V26, P287; IMF, 2005, 05148 IMF; JAFFEE DM, 1976, Q J ECON, V90, P651, DOI 10.2307/1885327; JAYARATNE J, 1996, Q J ECON, V111, P639, DOI 10.2307/2946668; JOHNSON S, 2002, J LAW ECON ORGAN, V18, P221, DOI 10.1093/JLEO/18.1.221; KING RG, 1993, Q J ECON, V108, P717, DOI 10.2307/2118406; KING RG, 1993, J MONETARY ECON, V32, P513, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(93)90028-E; KOKKO A, 2004, EUROPEAN I JAPANESE, V193; LA PORTA R, 1998, J POLIT ECON, V106, P1113, DOI 10.1086/250042; LA PORTA R, 2003, Q J ECON, V118, P231, DOI 10.1162/00335530360535199; LAEVEN L, 2001, J COMP ECON, V29, P207, DOI 10.1006/JCEC.2001.1708; LAPORTA R, 1997, J FINANC, V52, P1131, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-6261.1997.TB02727.X; LAPORTA R, 2000, NATL BUREAU EC RES W, V7620; LE N.

RELYING ON A LARGE SAMPLE OF NOTARISED LOANS, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE CREDIT MARKET AS LENDERS AND BORROWERS. HOWEVER, THEIR PARTICIPATION WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF MEN. IN ADDITION, WOMEN RECEIVED SMALLER LOANS AND PAID HIGHER INTEREST RATES THAN MEN. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LOWER PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN AS BORROWERS AND THEIR SMALLER LOANS WERE LARGELY A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL. IN ADDITION, MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE IN INTEREST RATES RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENCES IN LOAN SIZES. AS WOMEN RECEIVED SMALLER LOANS AND THERE WERE PROBABLY FIXED COSTS INVOLVED IN GRANTING A LOAN, MAKING A LOAN TO A WOMAN IMPLIED A HIGHER AVERAGE COST. RESUMEN ESTE ARTICULO ANALIZA EL PAPEL DE LAS MUJERES Y LA DISCRIMINACION POR GENERO EN EL MERCADO DE CREDITO HIPOTECARIO EN PERU ENTRE 1860 Y 1875. BASANDONOS EN UNA MUESTRA SIGNIFICATIVA DE PRESTAMOS NOTARIALES, EL ARTICULO MUESTRA QUE LAS MUJERES PARTICIPARON EN EL MERCADO DE CREDITO COMO PRESTAMISTAS Y PRESTATARIAS. SIN EMBARGO, SU PARTICIPACION FUE MENOR QUE LA DE LOS HOMBRES. ADICIONALMENTE, LAS MUJERES RECIBIERON PRESTAMOS MAS PEQUENOS Y CON MAYORES TASAS DE INTERES QUE LOS HOMBRES. LA EVIDENCIA SUGIERE QUE LA MENOR PARTICIPACION DE LAS MUJERES COMO PRESTATARIAS Y EL MENOR TAMANO DE SUS PRESTAMOS SE DEBIERON EN GRAN MEDIDA A LA DISTRIBUCION DE COLATERAL. ADEMAS, EN GRAN MEDIDA LAS DIFERENCIAS EN TASAS DE INTERES SE EXPLICAN POR LAS DIFERENCIAS EN TAMANOS DE LOS PRESTAMOS. EN LA MEDIDA EN QUE LAS MUJERES RECIBIERON PRESTAMOS MAS PEQUENOS Y HUBO PROBABLEMENTE COSTOS FIJOS EN GARANTIZAR UN PRESTAMO, PRESTAR DINERO A UNA MUJER IMPLICO UN MAYOR COSTO PROMEDIO.","CTR CATOLICA GRAD BUSINESS SCH, LIMA 33, PERU.","ZEGARRA, LF (REPRINT AUTHOR), CTR CATOLICA GRAD BUSINESS SCH, JR DANIEL ALOMIA ROBLES 125-129, LIMA 33, PERU.","LFZEGARRAB@PUCP.EDU.PE",NA,NA,"ASIEDU E, 2012, AM ECON REV, V102, P532, DOI 10.1257/AER.102.3.532; AVERY R., 1996, MORTGAGE LENDING RAC, P75; BAYDAS MM, 1994, WORLD DEV, V22, P1073, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(94)90149-X; BECKER G., 1957, EC DISCRIMINATION; BESTER H, 1985, AM ECON REV, V75, P850; BEVERIDGE AA, 1985, J ECON HIST, V45, P393, DOI 10.1017/S0022050700034100; BLANCHARD L, 2008, J URBAN ECON, V63, P467, DOI 10.1016/J.JUE.2007.03.001; BLANCHFLOWER DG, 2003, REV ECON STAT, V85, P930, DOI 10.1162/003465303772815835; BONILLA H., 1974, GUANO BRUGUESIA PERU; BURNETTE J, 2008, CAMB STUD ECON HIST, P1, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511495779; BUVINIC M, 1990, WORLD DEV, V18, P695, DOI 10.1016/0305-750X(90)90018-S; CAMPRUBI C, 1957, HIST BANCOS PERU 186; CAVALLUZZO KS, 2002, J BUS, V75, P641, DOI 10.1086/341638; CAVALLUZZO KS, 1998, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V30, P771, DOI 10.2307/2601128; COSAMALON J., 1996, MUJERES FAMILIA SOC, P263; DEERE CD, 2005, HAHR-HISP AM HIST R, V85, P627, DOI 10.1215/00182168-85-4-627; DYMSKI GA, 2006, ELGAR ORIG REF, P215; EDELSTEIN D., 1977, WOMEN CREDIT DISCRIM; ENGELSEN J, 1978, THESIS UCLA LOS ANGE; FUENTES M., 1860, GUIA HIST DESCRIPTIV; GARCIA-CALDERON F., 1879, DICCIONARIO LEGISLAC, VI; GARCIA-CALDERON F., 1879, DICCIONARIO LEGISLAC, VII; GOOTENBERG P, 1990, [NO TITLE CAPTURED], V70, P1; HELLER CF, 2004, J INTERDISCIPL HIST, V35, P37, DOI 10.1162/002219504323091234; HOFFMAN PT, 1992, J ECON HIST, V52, P293, DOI 10.1017/S0022050700010743; HUNEFELD C, 1988, MUJERES ESCLAVITUD E; HUNT S, 1973, 34 PRINC U; HUNTER WC, 1996, J REAL ESTATE FINANC, V13, P57; LEVANO D, 2006, MUJERES FAMILIA SOC; LEVINE R, 2008, 14273 NBER; LEVY J, 2012, MAKING OF A MARKET: CREDIT, HENEQUEN, AND NOTARIES IN YUCATAN, 1850-1900, P1; MARICHAL CARLOS, 1992, HIST DEUDA EXTERNA A; MITCHELL B., 1998, INT HIST STAT AM 175; MORRISON ANDREW, 2007, GENDER EQUALITY POVE; OLIART P., 1995, MUNDOS INTERIORES, P261; PREMO BIANCA, 2006, MUJERES FAMILIA SOC, P593; PRESSNALL L.
